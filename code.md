## Deleting a Codespace

**Deleting a codespace will delete all files and folders therein.** If you are sure you want to delete a codespace:

1. Visit [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).
2. Under **Owned by code50**, to the right of `main`, click ***...***, select **Delete**, and click **OK**.

You can then create a new codespace by following the instructions at [code.cs50.io/settings](https://code.cs50.io/settings) again.
