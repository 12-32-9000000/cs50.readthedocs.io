Materials

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are some Media:Mattweek2.zip[demo programs] I used in Fall 2009
for Week 2.

* *array1.c*: Declares an array of ints of length 7 and allows user to
query contents.
* *array2.c*: Declares and initializes an array of ints of length 7,
then scales 2nd element by 2 using a function. Note pass by reference!
* *charinc.c*: What happens when we increment a char?
* *fun1.c*: Takes an int from the user and then squares(?) it using a
function.
* *fun2.c*: Uses functions to square a user-inputted int and print it
nicely.

And here are the Media:Week 2.pptx[slides] I prepared in Fall 2010 for
Week 2.

*Fall '10*:

:* Less comfy Media:Week2.ppt[Powerpoint Slides]!

:* Media:2source.zip[Source Code] (mostly embedded/referred to in
slides) *Fall '09*:

:* Less comfy Media:Section1.doc[Section Lesson Plan].

:* This was before I switched to PowerPoints, so it's probably
underwhelming and/or sloppy.

Media:section1.pdf[Here] my in-between section as prepared for Week 2 in
Fall 2009. I also added my source code I used for that week. You can
find source code examples Media:sect1_code.zip[here].

Media:Section 1 and 2 Handout - CS50 Ashin Shah.pdf[These] are my
handouts for Section 0 and Section 1. Enjoy! If other TFs intend to use
them, please keep the attribution to me, and just send me an email
saying that you are.

Media:section1_tmm.pdf[Here] are my slides for Section 1. Zipped source
code examples are Media:section1_tmm.zip[here].

I have always taught a section "for those less comfortable". Here are my
"cheat sheets" for Media:CheatSheet1_1.pdf[Week 1] and for
Media:CheatSheet2.pdf[Week 2]. 2010 was the first year I made these, and
I intend to hand them out (1) after section (2) only to those people who
actually attended. These are intended as a two-page capsule summary of
important topics. The goal is to refresh students' minds on these for
quiz-preparation purposes, ie. to remember the syntax of a loop. If
other TFs intend to use them, please keep the attribution to me, and
just send me an email saying that you are using them. These were
prepared using LaTeX.
