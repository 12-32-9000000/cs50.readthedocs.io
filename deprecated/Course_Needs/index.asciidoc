*This list is subject to change.*


Short Term
----------

*Target Date: January 2012*


LDAP Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Anyone with an HUID must be able to create an SEAS LDAP account (i.e.,
username and password). LDAP account must store username, password, full
name, and official email address. It's not necessary to provide users
with @seas.harvard.edu email addresses.
* Account creation must be self-service, whereby a student can visit a
URL 24/7, log in with their HUID and PIN, and proceed to create a
username and password without human intervention. (Their full name and
email address can be pulled from hu-ldap.harvard.edu based on their
HUID.)
* Courses must be able to authenticate users against LDAP so that they
can run their own VMs but leverage SEAS LDAP for accounts.


Home Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Anyone with an LDAP account must also have a home directory whose
quota is >= 1GB (which can be increased by request).
* Home directories must be exported via NFS so that courses' VMs can
mount. (Courses can provide the IPs to which NFS exports can be
restricted.) It's not necessary to NFS-export home directories to
students' own VMs on campus.
* Home directories must also be accessible via WebDAV, sshfs, SFTP, etc.
* Home directories should be snapshotted every 10m, 1h, 1d, 1m via
NetApp in hardware (or equivalent) or rsnapshot in software, with
snapshots accessible via a read-only volume (exported via NFS, WebDAV,
and SFTP).


After-Hours Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Faculty must have access to an on-call cell phone number that's
carried 24/7 by SEAS technical staff in case problems arise at night or
on weekends, instead of a voicemail box. Number should be a constant and
simply forward to whoever's on call.


VMs
~~~

* Courses must be able to request headless VMs for their courses or
students. VMs would live on SEAS hardware.
* Standard, base installations of CentOS 6, Fedora 15, Ubuntu 11, Ubuntu
10 LTS, et al. should be available, preconfigured to mount Home
Directories and authenticate against LDAP.


Long Term
---------

*Target Date: Fall 2012*


Appliance
~~~~~~~~~

* Provide students with an virtual appliance preconfigured for specific
courses.

_A new version of the CS50 Appliance that will support other courses as
well is already in progress:_

https://manual.cs50.net/CS50_Appliance_2.0


Git Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Central git repository to which anyone with an SEAS LDAP account can
log in and create public or private repositories (for homework
submissions and personal use).
* Faculty and TFs can be granted access to student repos via SSH keys.
* Pushes must be possible via ssh:// (keys) and https:// (with
usernames/passwords).
* API via which course staff can install keys in students' and TFs'
accounts.
* Must support pushable tags.

_CS50 is currently evaluating GitHub:FI for this purpose. Results TBD._
