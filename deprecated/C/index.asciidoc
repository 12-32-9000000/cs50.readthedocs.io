*C* is the main programming language used in CS50. It's a relatively
low-level language, meaning that it gives you direct access to the
computer's memory.

When a C program starts execution the function called `main` is
executed. Within this function, the link:statement[statements] that make
up the function are executed in sequence. For example, the following
program:

--------------------------------
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int a = 17;
   int b = 42;
   int c = a + b;
   return c;
}
--------------------------------

will successively set one variable to 17, another to 42, a third to the
sum of those variables, and then return that value.
