Cyberduck is a free SFTP client for Mac OS that you can download from
http://cyberduck.ch/[http://cyberduck.ch/]. Once downloaded, drag
*Cyberduck.app* from your *Downloads* folder (or wherever you saved it)
to your *Applications* folder.

Once installed, launch Cyberduck, and you should see a window like the
below.

Proceed to click *Bookmarks* at top-left, then click the plus (*+*) icon
at bottom-right. Configure the window that appears per the below, where
*username* is your own username on `cloud.cs50.net`. Take care to select
*SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)* via the drop-down menu at the top of
the window.

Then close the smaller of the two windows and double-click
*cloud.cs50.net* in the original window. Provide your password when
prompted. You should then see the contents of your home directory. You
can then proceed to drag and drop files to and from your own desktop.
Explore the program's menus for additional features.
