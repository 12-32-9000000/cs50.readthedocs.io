_HTTP. HTML. PHP_


Agenda
------

* Announcements
** Problem Set 5 has been returned.
** Want to do Problem Set 5's scavenger hunt?? Ends at 11:59pm on
Fri11/12, but we should submit sooner in case there's a tie!
** Final Project's Pre-Proposal is due by 11:00am on Mon 11/8, per the
http://www.cs50.net/projects/project.pdf[spec]
* HTML
** tags, attributes
** students can use any version of HTML or XHTML this year so long as it
validates at http://validator.w3.org/[validator.w3.org]; I'd recommend
HTML for its simpler DOCTYPE and `&lt;html&gt;` tag.
* `chmod`
** `a+x` or `711` for directories, including `~` and `~/public_html/`
** `600` (which is the default on the cloud, so no need to type for each
file) for PHP files
** `a+r` or `644` for all other files (including CSS, JavaScript,
images, etc.)
* CSS
** `style` attribute
** external stylesheet (using `link` tag in `head` to reference external
file)
** internal stylesheet (using `style` tag in `head`)
* PHP
** Using `$_GET` and `$_POST`
* SQL (if time permits)
** Using `https://cloud.cs50.net/phpMyAdmin/` to create and browse
tables.
** `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE` with `mysql_query`

*Note that, in Week 8's lectures, we only did `froshims1.php` (and
`register1.php`) through `froshims3.php` (and `register3.php`) from Week
8's https://www.cs50.net/lectures/8/src/froshims/[source code]. We'll
finish up the rest and introduce MySQL on Mon 11/1 in lecture.*
