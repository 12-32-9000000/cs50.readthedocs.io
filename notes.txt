Current issues:
    Loading logic:
        trailing slashes break the path finding (/appliance/17 will render /html/appliance/17.asciidoc, but /appliance/17/ will render a blank page)
    Mediawiki files:
        YAML is not added by pandoc, a small wrapper can make this work (FIXED - file name is temporary title)
        Category at the bottom is left in
        internal anchors are broken
        asciidoc warnings are printed out at the top of the page (see appliance/17)
        some things unsupported
            multicell tables in appliance/17
            code/text rendering in api/courses
            ...
