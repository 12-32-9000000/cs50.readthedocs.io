= CS50 Appliance 2.3
:toc: left

*This HOWTO is for version 2.3 of the CS50 Appliance.*

* *If following https://www.cs50.net/[Fall 2011] of CS50, you should use
this version of the appliance.*
* *If following http://cs50.tv/2010/fall/[Fall 2010] of CS50, you should
use link:../2.1[version 2.1] of the appliance.*
* *If following http://cs50.tv/2009/fall/[Fall 2009] of CS50, you should
use link:../1.4[version 1.4] instead.*

The CS50 Appliance is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machine] (VM) that
lets you "take" CS50, even if you're not a student at Harvard.

It's based on
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)[Fedora], a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux[Linux]-based
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system[operating system]. It's an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_appliance[appliance] in the sense
that we've preconfigured this VM for a specific purpose: CS50!

In other words, even if you're not a student in CS50, you can still play
along at home. The CS50 Appliance will let you compile source code from
https://www.cs50.net/lectures/[lectures] and implement
https://www.cs50.net/psets/[problem sets] without having to figure out
how to configure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection[GCC], etc.
yourself. Moreover, the CS50 Appliance lets you run Linux inside of a
window on your own computer, even if you're already running (some other
version of) Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, or Windows!

Incidentally, the appliance is always work in progress, so please
forgive any bugs! We'll document link:#_known_issues[known issues] down
below.

== Instructions


=== How to Install Appliance

In order to install the appliance, you first need to install a program
called a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor[hypervisor] that will
let you run http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual
machines] on your own computer, whether you run Linux, Mac OS, Solaris,
or Windows. Unless you already own a hypervisor (e.g., Parallels, VMware
Fusion, or VMware Workstation), *CS50 recommends that you download and
install link:#_virtualbox[VirtualBox] because it's free and
cross-platform.*

*Once installed, it's not uncommon for the appliance to take 1 – 2
minutes to boot. But if, once at John Harvard's desktop, the appliance
still feels unbearably slow, you might need to enable
link:../../Hardware_Virtualization[hardware virtualization] on your computer
if it's a PC running Windows or Linux. (Hardware virtualization should
be enabled by default on any Intel-based Mac manufactured in the past
few years.) Even with hardware virtualization enabled, though, virtual
machines might still feel slow if your computer is a few years old, has
a CPU that's only 1GHz or so, or has only 1GB or so of RAM.*


==== VirtualBox

Here's how to install the appliance using VirtualBox.

1.  Install VirtualBox per
+
+
these instructions
+
+
.
2.  Download the latest appliance at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/2.3/cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf.zip. Then
unzip it. Do not double-click the files within.
3.  Launch VirtualBox (as by single- or double-clicking its icon,
wherever you installed it).
4.  Select *Import Appliance...* from VirtualBox's *File* menu. Click
*Choose*. Navigate your way to that unzipped *cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf*
folder, highlight the *cs50-appliance-2.3.ovf* file within, and click
*Open*. Then click *Next*. You should see a summary of the appliance's
settings. Click *Import*. You'll then be prompted to agree to the
appliance's http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/[license].
If you click *Agree*, you'll see *CS50 Appliance 2.3* in VirtualBox's
left-hand menu after a few seconds or minutes. Click *CS50 Appliance
2.3* to highlight it, then click *Start*.

That's it! To learn how to use the appliance, see further
link:#_how_to_use_appliance[instructions] down below!


=== How to Update Appliance

The latest release of version 2.3 of the CS50 Appliance is *2.3-14*. To
check which version you have, link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[open a
terminal] and execute:

`rpmquery cs50-appliance`

You should see output like the below, which indicates (between
`cs50-appliance-` and `.i386`) the release that you have installed:

`cs50-appliance-2.3-14.i386`

You can update the appliance to the latest release in either of two
ways:

* Select *Menu > Administration > Software Update*, then click *Install
Updates* if any updates are available.
* link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute:
+
---------------------------------------
sudo yum clean all ; sudo yum -y update
---------------------------------------
+
Input *crimson* if prompted for a password.

Don't worry if you see

`  Updating   : cs50-appliance-2.3-14.i386`

or similar on the screen for a minute or more; it takes a while to
restart each of the appliance's services.


=== How to Use Appliance

The first thing you should see when the appliance boots up is John
Harvard's desktop. (Oh, henceforth, you are
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_(clergyman)[John Harvard].
Your initial password is *crimson*. And here's
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BostonTrip-91.jpg[what you look
like].) Even though you might think of Linux as having only a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[command-line
interface],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface[graphical user
interfaces] do exist. We've installed
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce[Xfce], one of the most popular, for
you. However, we installed as few programs as possible to keep the
appliance small. You're welcome to install additional programs via *Menu
> Administration > Add/Remove Applications*.


==== How to Change Name

As much as you might not like being called John, *do not try to change
John Harvard's name or username*. Life will be simpler as John.

With that said, if you'd _really_ like to be yourself (or someone else
altogether), you're welcome to create a new account.
link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute

`sudo adduser --comment "Jane Harvard" --gid students --groups wheel janeh` +
`echo crimson | sudo passwd --stdin janeh` +
`echo -e "crimson\ncrimson" | sudo smbpasswd -a -s janeh`

where `Jane Harvard` is your desired name, `crimson` is your desired
password, and `janeh` is your desired username. Be sure not to overlook
the `\n` in the second command.

If you'd also like to start logging into the appliance automatically
under your new identity (instead of John Harvard's), execute

`sudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf`

and change `jharvard` to your own username. Then hit *ctrl-x*, then *y*,
then *Enter* to save and quit.


==== How to Change Password

You can change your password in any of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Preferences > Password* and follow the on-screen
prompts.
* Log into Usermin at http://192.168.56.50:20000/, select *Login >
Change Password* at top-left, and follow the on-screen instructions.
* link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute: +
+
------
passwd
------

With that said, allow us to suggest that you not change John Harvard's
password if your own computer is already password-protected. (Life will
be simpler with *crimson*.) The appliance has been configured in such a
way that only someone with access to your computer (e.g., you) can
access the appliance. Even though the appliance can connect to the
Internet, the Internet cannot connect to the appliance.


==== How to Change Language

*This feature may require Internet access.*

If English is not your native language, you may want to change the
appliance's default language. Some things will remain in English, but
you might find yourself more at home nonetheless. Select *Menu >
Administration > Language*, inputting your password if prompted. Select
your preferred language from the list that appears, then click *OK*. If
prompted, click *Import key*. You may need to wait for a bit as the
language is installed. Then link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[restart the
appliance] and log back in.


==== How to Change Keyboard Layout

If you have a non-U.S. (or non-standard) keyboard, you may want (or
need!) to change your keyboard's layout. Select *Menu > Administration >
Keyboard*. (To be clear, select *Administration*, not *Preferences*.)
Select your preferred keyboard, then click *OK*.


==== How to Change Time Zone

If you don't live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, you may want to
change the appliance's timezone. Select *Menu > Administration > Date &
Time*. Click the *Time Zone* tab, select the nearest city in your time
zone, then click *OK*, leaving *System clock uses UTC* checked.


[[how_to_open_a_terminal]]
==== How to Open a Terminal

You can open a terminal in any of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Programming > Terminal* or *Menu > Accessories >
Terminal*. You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`).
* Click Terminal's icon (a black square) in the appliance's bottom-left
corner. You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`).
* Right-click anywhere on your desktop and select *Open Terminal Here*.
You'll find yourself in `~/Desktop/`.
* Select *Menu > Programming > gedit* or *Menu > Accessories > gedit*.
You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`) in gedit's bottom
panel.

No matter the approach you take, it's in the terminal window that you'll
be able to type commands like *cd*, `gcc`, `ls`, etc.


==== How to SSH to Appliance

If you'd like to SSH to the appliance from your own computer (as with
Terminal on Mac OS or with PuTTY on Windows), you can SSH from your
computer to *192.168.56.50*, which is the appliance's static IP address.
(The appliance actually has another IP address, obtained via DHCP, but
it uses that IP to access the Internet.)

If you'd instead like to SSH _from_ the appliance _to_ your computer
(assuming your computer is running an SSH server), you can SSH from the
appliance to *192.168.56.1*, which is the static IP address that
VirtualBox has secretly assigned to your computer.

*Note that, for security's sake, you can SSH to the appliance as
`jharvard` but not as `root`.*


==== How to Release Keyboard and Mouse

Once you click inside of the appliance, it "captures" your keyboard's
keystrokes and your mouse's movements (unless you've installed
link:#_how_to_install_guest_additions[guest additions] and haven't
selected *Machine > Disable Mouse Integration*. To release your keyboard
and mouse from the appliance's clutches, hit VirtualBox's "host key": on
a Mac, VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's left-Command key; on any
other OS, VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's right-Control key.
Once you hit that key, should be able to move your mouse anywhere on
your screen.


==== How to Change Host Key

VirtualBox's "host key" allows you to release your keyboard and mouse
from the appliance if they've been "captured," which happens when you
click somewhere inside of the appliance's window (unless you have
link:#_how_to_install_guest_additions[guest additions] installed).

On a Mac, VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's left-Command key; to
change it, select *VirtualBox > Preferences... > Input*. On any other
OS, VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's right-Control key; to
change it, select *File > Preferences > Input*. In either case, be sure
that VirtualBox's main window (where you can select the CS50 Appliance
from a list) is in the foreground, not the appliance's own window, else
the *Preferences...* and/or *File* menu might not appear.


==== How to Install Guest Additions

*These instructions assume that you're using VirtualBox as your
hypervisor. For VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation, you'll instead
want to install "VMware Tools."*

"Guest Additions" are device drivers and system applications that come
with VirtualBox that can improve the performance and usability of the
CS50 Appliance. Those additions allow you to
link:#_how_to_change_resolution[change the appliance's resolution],
link:#_how_to_enter.2fexit_fullscreen_mode[enter/exit fullscreen mode],
link:#_how_to_enter/exit_seamless_mode[enter/exit seamless mode], and
link:#_how_to_transfer_files_between_appliance_and_your_computer[share
folders] between the appliance and your own computer. They may also
eliminate the need to link:#_how_to_release_keyboard_and_mouse[release
your keyboard and mouse] via VirtualBox's "host key."

To install them, select *Install Guest Additions...* from VirtualBox's
*Devices* menu while the appliance is running. (This menu is outside of
the appliance, not inside of it. You may need to
link:#_how_to_release_keyboard_and_mouse[release your keyboard and mouse]
first.) An icon of a CD may then appear on your desktop, but no need to
double-click it. Instead, link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[open a terminal]
and execute the commands below. Input your password if prompted. (For
security, you will not see your password as you type it.)

`sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/` +
`sudo /media/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`

Once the software has been installed, execute the command below:

`sudo umount /media/`

Then select *CD/DVD Devices > Remove disk from virtual drive* from
VirtualBox's *Devices* menu. (This menu is outside of the appliance, not
inside of it. You may need to
link:#_how_to_release_keyboard_and_mouse[release your keyboard and mouse]
first.) Then link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[restart the appliance] and
log back in.


==== How to Change Resolution

By default, the appliance's resolution for John Harvard is 800x600 (so
that his desktop fits on most any computer's screen). To lower the
resolution to 640x480 or increase the resolution to 1024x768, select
*Menu > Preferences > Display*, select a new value to the right of
*Resolution*, then click *Close*.

To increase the appliance's resolution beyond 1024x768 and to enable
auto-resize (whereby dragging VirtualBox's bottom-left corner will alter
the appliance's resolution), you'll need to install
link:#_how_to_install_guest_additions[install guest additions], if you
haven't already.


==== How to Change Volume

1.  Select *Menu > Sound & Video > Mixer*.
2.  Select *Playback: Internal Audio Analog Stereo (PulseAudio Mixer)*
next to *Sound card*.
3.  Click '''Select Controls...".
4.  Check *Master* then click *Close*.
5.  Drag the sliders upward to increase the audio's volume.
6.  Click *Quit*.
7.  Visit http://webhamster.com/ in Firefox to test!


==== How to Enter/Exit Fullscreen Mode

For fullscreen mode to work, you'll first need to
link:#_how_to_install_guest_additions[install guest additions] if you
haven't already.

Thereafter, you can enter fullscreen mode in either of these ways:

* Select *Switch to Fullscreen* from VirtualBox's *Machine* menu while
the appliance is running. (This menu is outside of the appliance, not
inside of it.)
* Hit VirtualBox's "host key" and F together. (On a Mac, VirtualBox's
host key is your keyboard's left-Command key; on any other OS,
VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's right-Control key.)

You can exit fullscreen mode in either of these ways:

* Move your cursor to the middle of the bottom of your screen, at which
point a menu should appear. Click the second icon from the right (which
resembles two squares).
* Hit VirtualBox's "host key" and F together. (On a Mac, VirtualBox's
host key is your keyboard's left-Command key; on any other OS,
VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's right-Control key.)


==== How to Enter/Exit Seamless Mode

Seamless mode lets you "extract" windows (e.g., a Terminal window) from
the CS50 Appliance and position them right alongside your computer's own
windows; in seamless mode, the appliance's windows are no longer
confined to the appliance's own rectangular window.

For seamless mode to work, you'll first need to
link:#_how_to_install_guest_additions[install guest additions] if you
haven't already.

Thereafter, you can enter seamless mode in either of these ways:

* Select *Switch to Seamless Mode* from VirtualBox's *Machine* menu
while the appliance is running. (This menu is outside of the appliance,
not inside of it.)
* Hit VirtualBox's "host key" and L together. (On a Mac, VirtualBox's
host key is your keyboard's left-Command key; on any other OS,
VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's right-Control key.)

You can exit seamless mode by hitting VirtualBox's "host key" and L
together. (On a Mac, VirtualBox's host key is your keyboard's
left-Command key; on any other OS, VirtualBox's host key is your
keyboard's right-Control key.)


==== How to Use phpMyAdmin

You can access phpMyAdmin in either of these ways:

* Visit http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/ or http://192.168.56.50/phpMyAdmin/
using Firefox within the appliance.
* Visit http://192.168.56.50/phpMyAdmin/ using your own computer's
browser.

No matter the approach you take, log in as *jharvard* (or, if necessary,
*root*) with a password of *crimson* if prompted.


==== How to Restore Snapshots

Every 10 minutes, the appliance take "snapshots" of source code in
`/home` just in case you accidentally delete something. (You can also
mitigate accidental deletions by
link:#_how_to_synchronize_files_with_dropbox[synchronizing with
Dropbox].)

Suppose that you just deleted `~/pset1/hello.c`. Odds are you'll find it
in the `minutely.0` or `minutely.1` snapshot, depending on the current
time, in which case you can recover it with

`cp /.snapshots/minutely.0/home/jharvard/pset1/hello.c ~/pset1`

or with

`cp /.snapshots/minutely.1/home/jharvard/pset1/hello.c ~/pset1`

in a link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[terminal]. If you need to recover an
earlier version, you can go further back in time via `minutely.2`,
`minutely.3`, or `minutely.4`. If you'd instead like to go back an hour
or so, you can start with `hourly.0`, followed by `hourly.1`,
`hourly.2`, and so on. Below are all of the intervals you can try.
Realize that the times only estimates, since the intervals' definitions
depend on the current time.

[cols=",",]
|====================================================
|`minutely.0` |10 minutes ago
|`minutely.1` |20 minutes ago
|`minutely.2` |30 minutes ago
|`minutely.3` |40 minutes ago
|`minutely.4` |50 minutes ago
|`hourly.0` |1 hour ago
|`hourly.1` |2 hours ago
|... |...
|`hourly.22` |23 hours ago
|`daily.0` |yesterday
|`daily.1` |2 days ago
|... |...
|`daily.5` |6 days ago
|`weekly.0` |1 week ago
|`weekly.1` |2 weeks ago
|... |...
|`weekly.51` |51 weeks ago
|====================================================

To see which intervals are actually available to you, execute:

`ls /.snapshots/`


==== How to Synchronize Files with Dropbox

*This feature requires Internet access.*

To make it easier to back up files within the appliance automatically as
well as share them with your own computer(s), you can synchronize a
directory in John Harvard's account with
http://www.dropbox.com/features[Dropbox]. *If officially enrolled in a
course at Harvard, just take care to respect the course's policies on
academic honesty.*

Here's how to configure the appliance for Dropbox.

1.  link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal].
2.  Execute:
+
----------------
dropbox start -i
----------------
3.  You should be prompted to "download the proprietary daemon" (i.e.,
software); click *OK*. The software should proceed to download and
unpack.
4.  You should then be prompted to set up Dropbox.
* If you don't already have a Dropbox account, leave *I don't have a
Dropbox account* checked, then click *Next*. Create your Dropbox as
prompted.
* If you already have an Dropbox account, check *I already have a
Dropbox account*, then click *OK*. Log in as prompted.
5.  If prompted to upgrade your Dropbox, simply leave *2 GB* checked
(which is free) then click *Next*, unless you want to upgrade to a paid
account.
6.  If prompted to *Choose setup type*, leave *Typical* checked, then
click *Install*.
7.  If prompted to take a 5-step tour, click *Skip Tour*; its
screenshots won't match what you'll see in the appliance.
8.  When informed *That's it!*, uncheck *Open my Dropbox folder now*,
then click *Finish*.
9.  If prompted for your admin password, input *crimson* (unless you
changed your root password to something else). *Don't worry if you then
see an error about "wrong password."*

If you then execute

`dropbox status`

you should see:

`Idle`

If you then execute

`cd ~/Dropbox/` +
`ls`

you should your dropbox's files. If you just created an account, among
them will be *Getting Started.pdf*, *Photos*, and *Public*. You can
browse those same files (and any others you create) at
https://www.dropbox.com/login. You can even undelete files.

*Only those files and folders that you save in `~/Dropbox/` will be
synchronized with your Dropbox account.*


==== How to Transfer Files between Appliance and Your Computer

If you'd like to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol[SFTP] to the
appliance from your own computer (as with
http://cyberduck.ch/[Cyberduck] on Mac OS or with
http://winscp.net/eng/download.php[WinSCP] on Windows), you can SFTP
from your computer to *192.168.56.50*, which is the appliance's static
IP address. (The appliance actually has a second IP address, obtained
via DHCP, but it uses that IP to access the Internet.)

Alternatively, you can "mount" John Harvard's home directory (via a
protocol called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block[SMB],
otherwise known as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS[CIFS]) in a window
on your own desktop, to and from which you can drag and drop files.
Here's how, whether you run Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.

==== How to Access Appliance from Another Computer

By default, you can access the appliance from your own computer via the
appliance's static IP address, which is *192.168.56.50*, because
VirtualBox assigns your own computer a static IP address of
*192.168.56.1*, which is on the same "subnet." Those IP addresses only
exist within VirtualBox, though, so, by default, it's _not_ possible to
access the appliance from other computers on your LAN (i.e., home
network).

However, the appliance also comes with a "bridged" network interface
(`eth2`) that you can activate manually. So long as your LAN supports
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP]
(which most home networks do), that interface will acquire an IP address
on your LAN, at which point you can access the appliance via HTTP or SSH
via _that_ IP from any computer on your LAN.

However, for security's sake, you will not be able (from any computer
besides your own, on which the appliance is running) to:

John Harvard's home directory] in a window on your desktop

You will be able to:

* access John Harvard's homepage at http://192.168.56.50/~jharvard/
* SSH to the appliance at 192.168.56.50

Unfortunately, odds are `eth2` will not work on Harvard's campus because
of Harvard's firewall.

*Before activating `eth2`, you should first
link:#_how_to_change_password[change John Harvard's password] to
something only you know for security's sake.*

To enable `eth2` temporarily, link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[open a
terminal] and execute:

`sudo ifup eth2`

If your LAN indeed supports DHCP, you should see:

`Determining IP information for eth2... done.`

To find out which IP address was assigned by your LAN to the appliance,
execute

`ifconfig eth2`

and look to the right of *inet addr* (not *inet6 addr*). That's the
address via which you can accessible the appliance from another computer
on your LAN. Odds are it will start with *192.168.0* or *192.168.1* or
*10.0.1*, though other prefixes are possible.

If you would like to enable `eth2` permanently:

1.  Select *Menu > Administration > Network*.
2.  Highlight *eth2* in the window that appears, then click *Edit*.
3.  Check *Activate device when computer starts*, then click *OK*.
4.  Select *File > Save*, then click *OK*.
5.  Select *File > Quit*.
6.  link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[Restart the appliance].

Just realize that each time the appliance starts, it may be assigned a
different IP address on your LAN via DCHP, so you might need to re-run

`ifconfig eth2`

each time to find out the current address. If your home router supports
"DHCP reservations," know that you can find out the MAC (i.e., Ethernet)
address of `eth2` by running

`ifconfig eth2`

as well. Look to the right of *HWaddr* for the address. Alternatively,
if you think it's safe to assign the appliance a static IP address on
your LAN without your home router even knowing, select *Menu >
Administration > Network*, highlight *eth2* in the window that appears,
click *Edit*, select *Statically set IP addresses*, and configure the
interface as you see fit.


==== How to Take a Screenshot

It's sometimes helpful to take a screenshot of the appliance so that you
can remember or share something you see on your screen. *If officially
enrolled in a course at Harvard, just take care to respect the course's
policies on academic honesty.*

To take a screenshot inside of the appliance:

1.  Select *Menu > Accessories > Screenshot*.
2.  Check a *Region to capture*.
3.  Leave *Capture the mouse pointer* checked unless you'd like to hide
it.
4.  Leave *Delay before capturing* at *1*, unless you need more time.
5.  Click *OK*.
6.  You should then be prompted to decide on an *Action*. Leave *Save*
checked and then click *OK* if you'd like to save the screenshot as a
file; decide on a destination as prompted. You can then share that
screenshot with someone if necessary, as by opening Gmail in Firefox and
sending it as an attachment.

You can also link:#_how_to_share_control_of_your_screen[share control of
your screen] if you need someone else to see more than a screenshot.


==== How to Share Control of Your Screen

*This feature requires Internet access.*

So that you can help (and be helped by!) fellow learners on the
Internet, the appliance comes with
http://www.teamviewer.com/[TeamViewer], which lets you share (control
of) your screen with someone else (a "partner") on the Internet (and
vice versa). *If officially enrolled in a course at Harvard, just take
care to respect the course's policies on academic honesty.*

To share your screen with some else:

1.  Select *Menu > Share Screen*. A window should appear.
2.  Tell your partner the *ID* and *Password* that you see. Once your
partner inputs those values, your screen should be shared. Though if
your own computer has a firewall, you might first be prompted to "allow
incoming connections" or the like.

To see someone else's screen:

1.  Ask your partner for an *ID* and *Password*.
2.  Select *Menu > Share Screen*. A window should appear.
3.  Input the *ID* into that window, then click *Connect to partner*.
4.  When prompted, input the *Password*, at which point you should see
your partner's screen.

If you would like to connect to someone else's appliance from your own
computer (rather than from your own appliance) or from a mobile device,
you can download TeamViewer for free for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, or
Windows from http://www.teamviewer.com/en/download.aspx.


==== How to Disable Automatic Login

By default, the appliance logs you in as John Harvard. To disable
automatic login, link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[open a terminal] and
execute:

`sudo rm -f /etc/gdm/custom.conf`

Then link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[restart the appliance]. You should
now see a login prompt instead of John Harvard's desktop.


==== How to Log Out of Appliance

To log out of the appliance, click
image:Exit.png[Exit.png,title="image"] in the appliance's bottom-right
corner, then click *Log Out*.


==== How to Restart Appliance

You can restart the appliance in either of these ways:

* Click image:Exit.png[Exit.png,title="image"] in the appliance's
bottom-right corner, then click *Restart*.
* link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute the below,
inputting your password if prompted:
+
------------
sudo restart
------------


==== How to Shut Down Appliance

You can shut down the appliance in either of these ways:

* Click image:Exit.png[Exit.png,title="image"] in the appliance's
bottom-right corner, then click *Shut Down*.
* link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute the below,
inputting your password if prompted:
+
-------------
sudo shutdown
-------------


==== How to Configure Appliance for a Proxy Server

If your own computer sits behind an HTTP proxy server, you might need to
configure the appliance to route HTTP traffic through that proxy as
well. Here's how.

1.  link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute the below,
inputting your password if prompted:
+
---------------------------------
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
---------------------------------
2.  Add the following line to that (otherwise empty) file, where
`example.com` is the address of your proxy server and `80` is its port
number:
+
----------------------------------------
export http_proxy=http://example.com:80/
----------------------------------------
3.  Save and quit Nano by hitting *ctrl-X*, then *y*, then *Enter*.
4.  Execute:
+
--------------------------------------
sudo chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
--------------------------------------
5.  link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[Restart the appliance].

== Accessibility

The CS50 Appliance comes pre-configured with
http://live.gnome.org/Orca[Orca], a screen reader. To enable Orca,
select *Menu > Accessories > Orca*.

Note that Orca does work with:

* Eclipse
* Firefox
* gedit (but not its built-in terminal window)
* Xfce's menu (in the appliance's bottom-left corner)
* Xfce's panel (along the bottom of the appliance's screen)

But Orca does not work with:

* gedit's built-in terminal window
* Terminal
* Thunar, the appliance's file manager (via which you can open the
*Home* and *File System* icons on the appliance's desktop)

However, if you have a screen reader installed on your own computer, you
needn't rely on Orca alone. Instead, you can leverage your own screen
reader for navigation by link:#_how_to_ssh_to_appliance[SSHing to the
appliance] from your computer and by
link:#_how_to_transfer_files_between_appliance_and_your_computer[mounting
John Harvard's home directory] on your own computer.

*If you have suggestions on how to improve the appliance's
accessibility, please let sysadmins@cs50.net know!*


== Implementation Details

Below are details on how we implemented the CS50 Appliance in case
you're curious or would like to reproduce these steps yourself. *You do
NOT need to follow these directions to if you simply want to use the
CS50 Appliance:* you only need to follow link:#_instructions[the
instructions above].

We built the appliance using a combination of
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart[Kickstart] and
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package[rpmbuild]. It
took us a while to figure everything out, but now that we (and you) know
what we're doing, it only takes about 20 minutes to build the appliance
(and most of that time is spent waiting for Kickstart to run).

The CS50 Appliance's kickstart file can be found at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/2.3/cs50-appliance-2.3.ks. And the CS50
Appliance's spec file can be found at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/2.3/cs50-appliance-2.3.spec.

The directions below assume familiarity with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)[Fedora] and
installation thereof as well as with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox[VirtualBox]. If you have
questions, you may want to join CS50's Google Group at
http://cs50.tv/2010/fall/#l=psets&r=group[cs50.tv].

1.  Create a folder called *cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf* and then move
*cs50-appliance-2.3.ovf* and *cs50-appliance-2.3-disk1.vmdk* into that
folder.
2.  Create a ZIP of that folder called *cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf.zip*,
as with:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
zip -r -n .vmdk  cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf.zip cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
This use of `-n` tells `zip` not to compress
`cs50-appliance-2.3-disk1.vmdk` (since it's already compressed).
3.  Distribute `cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf.zip`!


=== VMware

VirtualBox exports VMDK files in a "streamOptimized" (i.e., compressed)
format that VMware's products do not support. However, it's possible to
convert `cs50-appliance-2.3-disk1.vmdk` to a "monolithicSparse" format
that VMware's products do understand, as with:

`mkdir cs50-appliance-2.3-vmx ` +
`vmware-vdiskmanager -r /path/to/cs50-appliance-2.3-14-ovf/cs50-appliance-2.3-disk1.vmdk -t 0 cs50-appliance-2.3-14-vmx/cs50-appliance-2.3-disk1.vmdk`

`vmware-vdiskmanager` comes with VMware Fusion (in
`/Application/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/`) and VMware
Workstation (in `C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation` or
`C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\`).

You'll then want to create a text file called `cs50-appliance-2.3.vmx`
in `cs50-appliance-2.3-14-vmx/` with these contents:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/vmware
config.version = "8"
displayName = "CS50 Appliance 2.3"
ethernet0.connectionType = "nat"
ethernet0.present = "TRUE"
ethernet1.connectionType = "hostonly"
ethernet1.present = "TRUE"
ethernet2.connectionType = "bridged"
ethernet2.present = "TRUE"
floppy0.present = "FALSE"
guestinfo.vmware.product.class = "virtual machine"
guestinfo.vmware.product.long = "CS50 Appliance 2.3"
guestinfo.vmware.product.url = "https://manual.cs50.net/CS50_Appliance_2.3"
guestOS = "fedora"
ide1:0.autodetect = "TRUE"
ide1:0.deviceType = "cdrom-raw"
ide1:0.fileName = "auto detect"
ide1:0.present = "TRUE"
ide1:0.startConnected = "TRUE"
memsize = "768"
powerType.powerOff = "soft"
powerType.powerOn = "soft"
powerType.reset = "soft"
powerType.suspend = "soft"
priority.grabbed = "normal"
priority.ungrabbed = "normal"
scsi0:0.deviceType = "disk"
scsi0:0.fileName = "cs50-appliance-2.3-disk1.vmdk"
scsi0:0.mode = "persistent"
scsi0:0.present = "TRUE"
scsi0:0.startConnected = "TRUE"
scsi0:0.writeThrough = "TRUE"
scsi0.present = "TRUE"
scsi0.virtualDev = "lsilogic"
sound.present = "TRUE"
sound.virtualdev = "sb16"
tools.syncTime = "TRUE"
tools.upgrade.policy = "upgradeAtPowerCycle"
usb.generic.autoconnect = "TRUE"
usb.present = "TRUE"
virtualHW.version = "7"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then create a ZIP of that folder called
*cs50-appliance-2.3-vmx.zip*, as with:

`zip -r cs50-appliance-2.3-14-vmx.zip cs50-appliance-2.3-14-vmx/`

Note the absence of `-n` this time, as the VMware-compatible VMDK is not
itself compressed and thus should be by `zip`.

You can then distribute `cs50-appliance-2.3-vmx.zip` as well!


== Troubleshooting

If having trouble with VirtualBox or the CS50 Appliance, see VirtualBox
and FAQs.


== Forget a password?


=== I forgot John Harvard's password

John Harvard's password is *crimson* by default. But if you changed it
to something you do not remember, you can change it to something you
know as follows:

1.  link:#_how_to_log_out_of_appliance[Log out] of the appliance if
already logged in.
2.  Log in as *root* with password *crimson* (unless you changed the
superuser's password too).
3.  link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal], execute
+
---------------
passwd jharvard
---------------
+
and input a new password for John Harvard (e.g., *crimson*) twice as
prompted.
4.  link:#_how_to_log_out_of_appliance[Log out] of the appliance.

You should then be able to log in as John Harvard again.


=== I forgot the root password

The superuser's password is *crimson* by default. But if you changed it
to something you do not remember, you can change it to something you
know as follows:

1.  link:#_how_to_shut_down_appliance[Shut down the appliance] if it's
already running.
2.  link:#_how_to_start_appliance[Start the appliance], immediately click
once inside of its window (so that your cursor disappears), and
immediately hold *Shift*. Within a few seconds, you should see a *GNU
GRUB* screen with *Generic* highlighted in white. If not, start over and
try again.
3.  Hit *e*, and you should see a screen with at least three options:
*root*, *kernel*, and *initrd*. Highlight *kernel* and hit *e* again.
You should then see a line of text that ends with `quiet`. Hit the space
bar and add the word `single` to the end of that line. Then hit *Enter*.
You should find yourself back at the previous screen, with *kernel*
highlighted in white.
4.  Hit *b* to boot into the appliance in "single-user mode.''' You
should soon see a terminal prompt.
5.  Execute
+
------
passwd
------
+
and input a new password twice (e.g., *crimson*) as prompted.
6.  Execute
+
------
reboot
------
+
to restart the appliance.


=== I forgot John Harvard's (or root's) MySQL password

John Harvard's password for MySQL is *crimson* by default, as is the
superuser's. But if you changed either to something you do not remember,
you can change both back to *crimson* by
link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[opening a terminal] and executing the
below:

`sudo yum -y reinstall cs50-appliance`

That command will restore the appliance to "factory defaults." It will
not delete any code that you've written.

* 2.3-9
** RPM no longer removes `/home/jharvard/.cache/sessions/*` and
`/root/.cache/sessions/*` to fix `xfwm4` crashes.
** John Harvard et al. now autostart these commands:
*** `xfvm4 --replace`, to fix frameless windows (seemingly the result of
an xfce4-sessions bug whereby `~/.cache/sessions/` results in `xfwm4`
dying)
*** `xfdesktop --reload`, to ensure Trash icon appears (on login) and
panel is properly drawn (after RPM update)
** Appliance no longer allows
`/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` to be created (and removes
existing one), to avoid problems whereby virtual NICs' MAC addresses
might be changed (by users).

be overwritten by the `cs50-appliance` RPM) were not being honored.
** Added support for `.foo.lock` in addition to `foo.lock` (which was
introduced but broken in -10).
** Fixed bug whereby John Harvard's and superuser's panels are properly
redrawn if `~/.config/xfce4/panel/*/*` gets updated for either.
** Wrapped `gedit` with `/usr/local/bin/gedit` to force backgrounding
(with `-b`) and to hide Gtk errors if run at command line.
** Altered `/usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop` to invoke
`gedit -b %F`; seems to ensure that `gedit` launches visibly when
double-clicked. (Previously, 4 clicks were sometimes necessary, as the
first 2 only spawned `gedit` in the background.)
** Altered `/usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop` to have
`StartupNotify=false` to eliminate spinning cursor, based on
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1454332 and
http://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/startup-notification.html.en.
** Added `/usr/local/{sbin,bin}` to John Harvard's `secure_path` for

** Changed hostname from `appliance` to `appliance.localdomain`.
** Imposed 4GB filesize limit on John Harvard.
** Imposed 16GB disk quota on John Harvard.
** Imposed 1M inode quota on John Harvard.
** Added snapshots of John Harvard's MySQL databases.
** Configured phpMyAdmin to hide MySQL's `test` database.
** Configured phpMyAdmin to no longer default to a specific database if
only one exists.
** Cleaned up `/etc/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php`.
** Added `/etc/skel/.config/xfce4/helpers.rc` (so that *Menu > Run
Program...* would launch Thunar for *sftp://* inputs).
** Changed `Exec=gedit -b %f` to `Exec=gedit -b %U` in
`/etc/skel/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop` (so that files on
SFTP mounts would open in gedit when double-clicked).
* 2.3-14 [not yet released]
** Added `php-tidy`.
** Enabled all `Options` and `Overrides` for `/var/www/html` in
`/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.
** Added `/etc/dhcp/dhclient-eth0.conf` so that DHCP lease (and thus DNS
servers) for `eth0` renews every 300 seconds to ensure appliance detects
change of networks within 300 seconds.
** Removed tunnel50 because hamachi-logmein's dependency on redhat-lsb
impedes kickstart.
** Replaced `/etc/skel/.config/autostart/{xfwm4,xfdesktop}.desktop` with
just `cs50.desktop`, which also restarts `xfce4-panel` (to avoid an
apparent Xfce bug whereby panel is sometimes empty).


== Future Work

Below are features that may be included in some future version of the
appliance.
