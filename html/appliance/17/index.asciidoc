The CS50 Appliance is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machine] (VM) that
lets you "take" CS50 (and other courses!), even if you're not a student
at Harvard.

It's based on
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)[Fedora], a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux[Linux]-based
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system[operating system]. It's an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_appliance[appliance] in the sense
that we've preconfigured this VM for a specific purpose: CS50!

In other words, even if you're not a student in CS50, you can still play
along at home. The CS50 Appliance will let you compile source code from
https://www.cs50.net/lectures/[lectures] and implement
https://cs50.tv/#l=psets/[problem sets] without having to figure out how
to configure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang[clang], etc. yourself.
Moreover, the CS50 Appliance lets you run Linux inside of a window on
your own computer, even if you're already running (some other version
of) Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, or Windows!

Incidentally, the appliance is always work in progress, so please
forgive any bugs!

== Instructions


[[how_to_install_appliance]]
=== How to Install Appliance

In order to install the CS50 Appliance, you first need to install a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor[hypervisor], which is a program
that will let you run
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machines] on your
own computer, whether you run Mac OS, Windows, or Linux.

* If you have a *Mac*, we recommend that you follow  link:VirtualBox[these instructions for VirtualBox].
* If you have a *PC running Windows*, we recommend that you follow link:VirtualBox[these instructions for VirtualBox].
* If you have a *PC running Linux*, we recommend that you follow link:VirtualBox[these instructions for VirtualBox].

Once installed, it's not uncommon for the appliance to take a minute or
so to boot. But if, once at John Harvard's desktop, the appliance still
feels unbearably slow, you might need to enable
link:../../Hardware_Virtualization[hardware virtualization] on your computer
if it's a PC running Windows or Linux. (Hardware virtualization should
be enabled by default on any Intel-based Mac manufactured in the past
few years.) Even with hardware virtualization enabled, though, virtual
machines might still feel slow if your computer is a few years old, has
a CPU that's only 1GHz or so, or has only 1GB or so of RAM.


[[how_to_update_appliance]]
=== How to Update Appliance

The latest version of the CS50 Appliance is *17-12*. More precisely, the
"latest release of version 17 of the appliance is 17-12." To confirm
that you have 17-12, look in the appliance's bottom-right corner, where
you should see *17-12* in boldface. Alternatively, you can
link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[open a terminal] and execute

`version50`

which should report `17-12` as well.

If you do not have the latest version, you can update your appliance by
link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[opening a terminal] and executing:

`update50`

Don't worry if you see

`  Updating   : appliance50-17-12.i386`

or similar on the screen for a minute or more; it takes a while to
restart each of the appliance's services.

*Note that you cannot update from version 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 3, or 17a of
the appliance to version 17. You must instead download 17, per the
link:#how_to_install_appliance[instructions] above. Thereafter, you'll
be able to update from 17-12 to future releases, per the above.*


[[how_to_use_appliance]]
=== How to Use Appliance

The first thing you should see when the appliance boots up is John
Harvard's desktop. (Oh, henceforth, you are
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_(clergyman)[John Harvard].
Your initial password is *crimson*. And here's
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BostonTrip-91.jpg[what you look
like].) Even though you might think of Linux as having only a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[command-line
interface],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface[graphical user
interfaces] do exist. We've installed
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce[Xfce], one of the most popular, for
you. However, we installed as few programs as possible to keep the
appliance small. You're welcome to install additional programs via *Menu
> Administration > Add/Remove Applications*.


==== How to Change Name

As much as you might not like being called John, *do not try to change
John Harvard's name or username*. Life will be simpler as John.

With that said, if you'd _really_ like to be yourself (or someone else
altogether), you're welcome to create a new account.
link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute

`sudo adduser --comment "Jane Harvard" --gid students --groups wheel janeh` +
`echo crimson | sudo passwd --stdin janeh` +
`echo -e "crimson\ncrimson" | sudo smbpasswd -a -s janeh`

where `Jane Harvard` is your desired name, `crimson` is your desired
password, and `janeh` is your desired username. Be sure not to overlook
the `\n` in the second command.

If you'd also like to start logging into the appliance automatically
under your new identity (instead of John Harvard's), execute

`sudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf`

and change `jharvard` to your own username. Then hit *ctrl-x*, then *y*,
then *Enter* to save and quit.


[[how_to_change_password]]
==== How to Change Password

You can change your password in any of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Settings > Password* and follow the on-screen prompts.
* link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute: +
+
------
passwd
------

With that said, allow us to suggest that you not change John Harvard's
password if your own computer is already password-protected. (Life will
be simpler with *crimson*.) The appliance has been configured in such a
way that only someone with access to your computer (e.g., you) can
access the appliance. Even though the appliance can connect to the
Internet, the Internet cannot connect to the appliance.


==== How to Change Language

*This feature may require Internet access.*

If English is not your native language, you may want to change the
appliance's default language. Some things will remain in English, but
you might find yourself more at home nonetheless. Select *Menu >
Administration > Language*, inputting your password if prompted. Select
your preferred language from the list that appears, then click *OK*. If
prompted, click *Import key*. You may need to wait for a bit as the
language is installed. Then link:#how_to_restart_appliance[restart the
appliance] and log back in.


==== How to Change Keyboard Layout

If you have a non-U.S. (or non-standard) keyboard, you may want (or
need!) to change your keyboard's layout as follows.

1.  Select *Menu > Settings > Keyboard*.
2.  Click *Layout*.
3.  Uncheck *Use system defaults*.
4.  Leave *Keyboard model* blank unless you have one of the keyboards
listed.
5.  Click *Add* down below *Keyboard layout*.
6.  Select your keyboard's layout (and variant, if any).
7.  Click *OK*.
8.  Ensure that your selection is now highlighted instead of *English
(US)*, then click *Close*.


==== How to Change Time Zone

If you don't live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, you may want to
change the appliance's timezone. Select *Menu > Administration > Date &
Time*. Click the *Time Zone* tab, select the nearest city in your time
zone, then click *OK*, leaving *System clock uses UTC* checked.


[[how_to_open_a_terminal]]
==== How to Open a Terminal

You can open a terminal in any of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Programming > Terminal* or *Menu > Accessories >
Terminal*. You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`).
* Click Terminal's icon (a black square) in the appliance's bottom-left
corner. You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`).
* Right-click anywhere on your desktop and select *Open Terminal Here*.
You'll find yourself in `~/Desktop/`.
* Select *Menu > Programming > gedit* or *Menu > Accessories > gedit*.
You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`) in gedit's bottom
panel.

No matter the approach you take, it's in the terminal window that you'll
be able to type commands like `cd`, `gcc`, `ls`, etc.


[[how_to_ssh_to_appliance]]
==== How to SSH to Appliance

If you'd like to SSH to the appliance from your own computer (as with
Terminal on Mac OS or with PuTTY on Windows), you can SSH from your
computer to the appliance's IP address (which is displayed in the
appliance's bottom-right corner).

*Note that, for security's sake, you can SSH to the appliance as
`jharvard` but not as `root`.*


==== How to Assign Appliance a Static IP Address

_Coming Soon_


==== How to Change Resolution

You can change the appliance's resolution (i.e., width and height) in
either of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Settings > Display* within the appliance, select a new
value to the right of *Resolution*, then click *Close*.
* Click and drag the appliance's bottom-right corner.


==== How to Change Volume

1.  Select *Menu > Sound & Video > Mixer*.
2.  Select *Playback: ES1371 [AudioPCO-97] Analog Stereo (PulseAudio
Mixer)* next to *Sound card*.
3.  Click '''Select Controls...".
4.  Check *Master* then click *Close*.
5.  Drag the sliders upward to increase the audio's volume.
6.  Click *Quit*.
7.  Visit http://www.youtube.com/ in Chrome to test with a video!


==== How to Enter/Exit Fullscreen Mode

To enter fullscreen mode, select *Switch to Fullscreen* from
VirtualBox's *Machine* menu while the appliance is running. (This menu
is outside of the appliance, not inside of it.)

To exit fullscreen mode, move your cursor to the middle of the bottom of
your screen, at which point a menu should appear. Click the second icon
from the right (which resembles two squares).


[[how_to_enable_apache]]
==== How to Enable Apache

By default, Apache (httpd) is disabled by default. To enable it,
link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[open a terminal] and execute:

[source,bash]
----
sudo chkconfig httpd on
sudo service httpd start
----

[[how_to_enable_mysql]]
==== How to Enable MySQL

By default, MySQL (mysqld) is disabled by default. To enable it,
link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[open a terminal] and execute:

[source,bash]
----
sudo chkconfig mysqld on
sudo service mysqld start
----


==== How to Use phpMyAdmin

You can access phpMyAdmin in either of these ways:

* Visit http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/ or http://w.x.y.z/phpMyAdmin/
(where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's IP address, which can be found in
the appliance's bottom-right corner) using Chrome within the appliance.
* Visit http://w.x.y.z/phpMyAdmin/ (where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's
IP address, which can be found in the appliance's bottom-right corner)
using your own computer's browser.

No matter the approach you take, log in as *jharvard* with a password of
*crimson* if prompted.


==== How to Restore Snapshots

Every 10 minutes, the appliance take "snapshots" of source code in
`/home` just in case you accidentally delete something. You can also
mitigate accidental deletions by
link:#how_to_synchronize_files_with_dropbox[synchronizing with Dropbox]
so that you can restore files at https://www.dropbox.com/[dropbox.com].

Suppose that you just deleted `~/hello.c`. Odds are you'll find it in
the `minutely.0` or `minutely.1` snapshot, depending on the current
time, in which case you can recover it with

`cp /.snapshots/minutely.0/home/jharvard/hello.c ~`

or with

`cp /.snapshots/minutely.1/home/jharvard/hello.c ~`

in a link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[terminal]. If you need to recover an
earlier version, you can go further back in time via `minutely.2`,
`minutely.3`, or `minutely.4`. If you'd instead like to go back an hour
or so, you can start with `hourly.0`, followed by `hourly.1`,
`hourly.2`, and so on. Below are all of the intervals you can try.
Realize that the times only estimates, since the intervals' definitions
depend on the current time.

[cols=",",]
|====================================================
|`minutely.0` |10 minutes ago
|`minutely.1` |20 minutes ago
|`minutely.2` |30 minutes ago
|`minutely.3` |40 minutes ago
|`minutely.4` |50 minutes ago
|`hourly.0` |1 hour ago
|`hourly.1` |2 hours ago
|... |...
|`hourly.22` |23 hours ago
|`daily.0` |yesterday
|`daily.1` |2 days ago

|`daily.5` |6 days ago
|`weekly.0` |1 week ago
|`weekly.1` |2 weeks ago
|... |...
|`weekly.51` |51 weeks ago
|====================================================

To see which intervals are actually available to you, execute:

`ls /.snapshots/`


==== How to Enable Dropbox

*This feature requires Internet access.*

To make it easier to back up files within the appliance automatically as
well as share them with your own computer(s), you can synchronize a
directory in John Harvard's account with
http://www.dropbox.com/features[Dropbox]. *If taking a course, just take
care to respect the course's policies on academic honesty.*

Here's how to configure the appliance for Dropbox.

1.  Select *Menu > Dropbox*.
2.  You should be prompted to "download the proprietary daemon" (i.e.,
software); click *OK*. The software should proceed to download and
unpack.
3.  You should then be prompted to set up Dropbox.
* If you don't already have a Dropbox account, leave *I don't have a
Dropbox account* checked, then click *Next*. Create your Dropbox as
prompted.
* If you already have an Dropbox account, check *I already have a
Dropbox account*, then click *OK*. Log in as prompted.
4.  If prompted to upgrade your Dropbox, simply leave *2 GB* checked
(which is free) then click *Next*, unless you want to upgrade to a paid
account.
5.  If prompted to *Choose setup type*, leave *Typical* checked, then
click *Install*. If prompted to "merge", click *Merge*.
6.  If prompted to take a 5-step tour, click *Skip Tour*; its
screenshots won't match what you'll see in the appliance.
7.  When informed *That's it!*, uncheck *Open my Dropbox folder now*,
then click *Finish*. A Dropbox icon should then appear in the
appliance's bottom-right corner.

*Only those files and folders that you save in `~/Dropbox/` will be
synchronized with your Dropbox account.*


How to Prevent Dropbox from Synching Personal Files _into_ the Appliance
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Ctrl-click on the Dropbox icon in the appliance's bottom-right
corner and select *Preferences...*.
2.  Click *Advanced*.
3.  Click *Selective Sync...*.
4.  Uncheck the folders that you don't want synched into the appliance.
5.  Click *Update*.


[[how_transfer_files_between_appliance_and_your_computer]]
==== How to Transfer Files between Appliance and Your Computer

If you'd like to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol[SFTP] to the
appliance from your own computer (as with
http://cyberduck.ch/[Cyberduck] on Mac OS or with
http://winscp.net/eng/download.php[WinSCP] on Windows), you can SFTP
from your computer to *w.x.y.z* (where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's IP
address, which can be found in the appliance's bottom-right corner).

Alternatively, you can "mount" John Harvard's home directory (via a

==== How to Access Appliance from Another Computer

*This feature is not supported on Harvard's campus on the "Harvard
University" SSID.* It does work on the "CS50" SSID in Annenberg and
Sanders Theatre, though.

By default, you can access the appliance from your own computer via
*w.x.y.z* (where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's IP address, which can be
found in the appliance's bottom-right corner). That IP address only
exists within the confines of your hypervisor, though, so, by default,
it's _not_ possible to access the appliance from other computers on your
LAN (i.e., home network).

However, the appliance also comes with a "bridged" network interface
(`eth2`) that you can activate manually. So long as your LAN supports
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP]
(which most home networks do), that interface will acquire an IP address
on your LAN, at which point you can access the appliance via HTTP or SSH
via _that_ IP from any computer on your LAN.

However, for security's sake, you will not be able (from any computer
besides your own, on which the appliance is running) to:

* access phpMyAdmin
* access Webmin
* link:#how_to_transfer_files_between_appliance_and_your_computer[mount
John Harvard's home directory] in a window on your desktop

You will be able to:

* access John Harvard's homepage
* SSH to the appliance

Unfortunately, odds are `eth2` will not work on Harvard's campus because
of Harvard's firewall.

*Before activating `eth2`, you should first
link:#how_to_change_password[change John Harvard's password] to
something only you know for security's sake.*

To enable `eth2` temporarily, link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[open a
terminal] and execute:

`sudo ifup eth2`

If your LAN indeed supports DHCP, you should see:

`Determining IP information for eth2... done.`

To find out which IP address was assigned by your LAN to the appliance,
execute

`ifconfig eth2`

and look to the right of *inet addr* (not *inet6 addr*). That's the
address via which you can accessible the appliance from another computer
on your LAN. Odds are it will start with *192.168.0* or *192.168.1* or
*10.0.1*, though other prefixes are possible.

If you would like to enable `eth2` permanently:

1.  Select *Menu > Administration > Network*.
2.  Highlight *eth2* in the window that appears, then click *Edit*.
3.  Check *Activate device when computer starts*, then click *OK*.
4.  Select *File > Save*, then click *OK*.
5.  Select *File > Quit*.
6.  link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[Restart the appliance].

Just realize that each time the appliance starts, it may be assigned a
different IP address on your LAN via DCHP, so you might need to re-run

`ifconfig eth2`

each time to find out the current address. If your home router supports
"DHCP reservations," know that you can find out the MAC (i.e., Ethernet)
address of `eth2` by running

`ifconfig eth2`

as well. Look to the right of *HWaddr* for the address. Alternatively,
if you think it's safe to assign the appliance a static IP address on
your LAN without your home router even knowing, select *Menu >
Administration > Network*, highlight *eth2* in the window that appears,
click *Edit*, select *Statically set IP addresses*, and configure the
interface as you see fit.


==== How to Take a Screenshot

It's sometimes helpful to take a screenshot of the appliance so that you
can remember or share something you see on your screen. *If taking a
course, just take care to respect the course's policies on academic
honesty.*

To take a screenshot inside of the appliance:

1.  Select *Menu > Accessories > Screenshot*.
2.  Check a *Region to capture*.
3.  Leave *Capture the mouse pointer* checked unless you'd like to hide
it.
4.  Leave *Delay before capturing* at *1*, unless you need more time.
5.  Click *OK*.
6.  You should then be prompted to decide on an *Action*. Leave *Save*
checked and then click *OK* if you'd like to save the screenshot as a
file; decide on a destination as prompted. You can then share that
screenshot with someone if necessary, as by opening Gmail in Firefox and
sending it as an attachment.

You can also link:#_how_to_share_control_of_your_screen[share control of
your screen] if you need someone else to see more than a screenshot.


==== How to Share Control of Your Screen

*This feature requires Internet access.*

So that you can help (and be helped by!) fellow learners on the
Internet, the appliance comes with
http://www.teamviewer.com/[TeamViewer], which lets you share (control
of) your screen with someone else (a "partner") on the Internet (and
vice versa). *If taking a course, just take care to respect the course's
policies on academic honesty.*

To share your screen with some else:

1.  Select *Menu > TeamViewer*. (Click *Accept License Agreement* if
prompted.) A window should appear.
2.  Tell your partner *Your ID* and *Password* that you see. Once your
partner inputs those values, your screen should be shared. Though if
your own computer has a firewall, you might first be prompted to "allow
incoming connections" or the like.

To see someone else's screen:

1.  Ask your partner for a *Partner ID* and *Password*.
2.  Select *Menu > TeamViewer*. (Click *Accept License Agreement* if
prompted.) A window should appear.
3.  Input the *Partner ID* into that window, then click *Connect to
partner*.
4.  When prompted, input the *Password*, at which point you should see
your partner's screen.

If you would like to connect to someone else's appliance from your own
computer (rather than from your own appliance) or from a mobile device,
you can download TeamViewer for free for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, or
Windows from http://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/.


==== How to Disable Automatic Login

By default, the appliance logs you in as John Harvard. To disable
automatic login, link:#_how_to_open_a_terminal[open a terminal] and
execute:

`sudo rm -f /etc/gdm/custom.conf`

Then link:#_how_to_restart_appliance[restart the appliance]. You should
now see a login prompt instead of John Harvard's desktop.

==== How to Configure Appliance for a Proxy Server

configure the appliance to route HTTP traffic through that proxy as
well. Here's how.

1.  link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[Open a terminal] and execute the below:
+
----------------------------------
sudo gedit /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
----------------------------------
2.  Add the following line to that (otherwise empty) file, where
`example.com` is the address of your proxy server and `80` is its port
number:
+
----------------------------------------
export http_proxy=http://example.com:80/
----------------------------------------
3.  Select *File > Quit*, and click *Save* when prompted.
4.  Execute
+
--------------------------------------
sudo chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
--------------------------------------
+
in the terminal.

Accessibility
-------------

The CS50 Appliance comes pre-configured with
http://live.gnome.org/Orca[Orca], a screen reader. To enable Orca,
select *Menu > Accessories > Orca*.

Note that Orca does work with:

* Chrome
* gedit (but not its built-in terminal window)
* NetBeans
* Xfce's menu (in the appliance's bottom-left corner)
* Xfce's panel (along the bottom of the appliance's screen)

But Orca does not work with:

* gedit's built-in terminal window
* Terminal
* Thunar, the appliance's file manager (via which you can open the
*Home* and *File System* icons on the appliance's desktop)

However, if you have a screen reader installed on your own computer, you
needn't rely on Orca alone. Instead, you can leverage your own screen
reader for navigation by link:#how_to_ssh_to_appliance[SSHing to the
appliance] from your computer and by
link:#how_to_transfer_files_between_appliance_and_your_computer[mounting
John Harvard's home directory] on your own computer.

*If you have suggestions on how to improve the appliance's
accessibility, please let sysadmins@cs50.net know!*


Forget a password?
------------------


=== I changed and forgot John Harvard's password

1.  Start (or link:#how_to_restart_appliance[restart]) the appliance.
2.  As soon as the appliance starts to boot, click inside of its window
(again and again, if need be), until your cursor is "captured" (i.e.,
disappears).
3.  When you see the black *GNU GRUB* screen, hit your keyboard's down
arrow to select _"Advanced options for Generic_', then hit Enter.
4.  On the screen that appears, select (with your keyboard's arrow keys)
the row that's parenthetically called *recovery mode*, then hit Enter.
5.  The appliance should boot more quickly than usual. When you see a
*root@appliance (~):* prompt, execute
+
---------------
passwd jharvard
---------------
+
and input a new password for John Harvard (e.g., *crimson*) twice as
prompted.
6.  Type
+
----
exit
----
+
to restart the appliance.

You should then be able to log in as John Harvard again.


=== I forgot John Harvard's MySQL password

John Harvard's password for MySQL is *crimson* by default. But if you
changed either to something you do not remember, you can change both
back to *crimson* by link:#how_to_open_a_terminal[opening a terminal]
and executing the below:

`sudo yum -y reinstall appliance50`

That command will restore the appliance to "factory defaults." It will
not delete any code that you've written.
