Here's how to install the link:../../CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] using
VirtualBox for link:#_mac_os[Mac OS], link:#Windows[Windows], and
link:#_linux[Linux].


Mac OS
------


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the instructions below, *4.x.y* represents whatever version of
VirtualBox is available on the day that you download it.

1.  Download the latest version of VirtualBox from
http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads by clicking *x86/amd64* to the
right of *VirtualBox 4.x.y for OS X Hosts*.
2.  Double-click the file you just downloaded. You may see a window that
says *Verifying...* after which a *VirtualBox* icon should appear on
your desktop (or on the lefthand side of a Finder window).
3.  Double-click the *VirtualBox* icon on your desktop (or single-click
the icon on the lefthand side of a Finder window). A window containing
*VirtualBox.mpkg* should then appear.
4.  Double-click *VirtualBox.mpkg*.
5.  A window entitled *Oracle VM VirtualBox for Mac OS X* should then
appear, in front of which should appear a smaller window that prompts
you to *determine if the software can be installed*. Click *Continue* on
both.
6.  A window entitled *Standard Install...* should then appear. Click
*Install*.
7.  If prompted for your username and password, provide both, then click
*Install Software*.
8.  A few seconds or minutes later, a window entitled *The installation
was completed successfully* should appear. Click *Close*.
9.  Launch VirtualBox, as by single- or double-clicking its icon,
wherever you installed it. (Odds are it's in *Applications*.)
10. Select *Preferences...* under VirtualBox's *VirtualBox* menu in your
display's top-left corner.
11. Click *Network*.
12. If *vboxnet0* does not already appear in the white box under
*Host-only Networks*, click the
image:Virtualbox-plus.png[Virtualbox-plus.png,title="image"] icon to the
right of that box, and *vboxnet0* should then appear in the box.
13. With *vboxnet0* highlighted in the white box under *Host-only
Networks*, click the
image:Virtualbox-screwdriver.png[Virtualbox-screwdriver.png,title="image"]
icon to the right of that box.
14. A window with two tabs should then appear. Click *Adapter*, if not
selected already. Ensure that the window contains precisely these
values:
* *IPv4 Address:* 192.168.56.1
* *IPv4 Network Mask:* 255.255.255.0
* *IPv6 Address:*
* *IPv6 Network Mask Length:* 0
15. Click *OK*.
16. Click *DHCP Server*. Ensure that *Enable Server* is checked and that
the window contains precisely these values:
* *Server Address:* 192.168.56.100
* *Server Mask:* 255.255.255.0
* *Lower Address Bound:* 192.168.56.101
* *Upper Address Bound:* 192.168.56.254

19. Download a ZIP file of the link:../../CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15-ovf.zip. That ZIP
file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
20. Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder
named *cs50-appliance-3* with two files within (*cs50-appliance-3.ovf*
and *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk*). Odds are that folder's in your
*Downloads* folder, unless you saved it elsewhere. Do not double-click
*cs50-appliance-3.ovf* or *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk*.
21. Launch VirtualBox, if not running already, as by single- or
double-clicking its icon, wherever you installed it. (Odds are it's in
*Applications*.)
22. Select *Import Appliance...* from VirtualBox's *File* menu.
23. Click *Choose*.
24. Navigate your way to the *cs50-appliance-3* folder that you
unzipped, highlight the *cs50-appliance-3.ovf* file within, and click
*Open*. Then click *Next*.
25. You should see a summary of the appliance's settings. Click
*Import*.
26. You'll then be prompted to agree to the appliance's
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/[license]. If you click
*Agree*, you'll see *CS50 Appliance 3* in VirtualBox's left-hand menu
after a few seconds or minutes.
27. Click *CS50 Appliance 3* to highlight it, then click *Start* to
start the appliance.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Nonexistent host networking interface, name '' (VERR_INTERNAL_ERROR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some reason, VirtualBox doesn't always come with a "host-only
adapter" configured. (A "host-only adapter" lets you connect to the
link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] via HTTP, SSH, and the like.) To
resolve this problem:

1.  Launch VirtualBox. (If VirtualBox is already running, shut down any
virtual machines that are running, as by clicking the red circle in the
top-left corner of each's window.)
2.  Select *Preferences...* under VirtualBox's *VirtualBox* menu in your
display's top-left corner.
3.  Click *Network*.
4.  If *vboxnet0* does not already appear in the white box under
*Host-only Networks*, click the
image:Virtualbox-plus.png[Virtualbox-plus.png,title="image"] icon to the
right of that box, and *vboxnet0* should then appear in the box.
5.  Click *OK*.
6.  Single-click whichever virtual machine originally triggered the
error (e.g., the link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance]), then click
*Settings*.
7.  Click *Network*.
8.  Click each of *Adapter 1*, *Adapter 2*, *Adapter 3*, and *Adapter
4*. If any of them has both *Enable Network Adapter* checked and a value
of *Host-only Adapter* for *Attached to* (as should the
link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] for *Adapter 2*), ensure that the
adapter also has a value of *vboxnet0* now for *Name*, selecting it
yourself from the drop-down menu next to *Name* yourself if necessary.
9.  Click *OK*.
10. Start whichever virtual machine originally triggered the problem
(e.g., the link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance]); it should now be
gone.


Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_SUPLIB_OWNER_NOT_ROOT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This message usually indicates that `/Applications` is not owned by
`root` but, rather, by a user account (e.g., your own). To resolve this
problem:

1.  Launch *Applications > Utilities > Terminal*, which will provide you
with a command-line environment on your own Mac.
2.  Type
+
-----------------------------
sudo chown root /Applications
-----------------------------
+
followed by Enter, inputting your password if prompted.
3.  Quit Terminal via *File > Quit Terminal*.
4.  Launch VirtualBox, if not already running.
5.  Start whichever virtual machine originally triggered the problem
(e.g., the link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance]); it should now be
gone.

Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_SUPLIB_WORLD_WRITABLE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This message usually indicates that that `/Applications` is
world-writable for some reason. To resolve this problem:

1.  Launch *Applications > Utilities > Terminal*, which will provide you
with a command-line environment on your own Mac.
2.  Type
+
----------------------------
sudo chmod o-w /Applications
----------------------------
+
followed by Enter, inputting your password if prompted.
3.  Quit Terminal via *File > Quit Terminal*.
4.  Launch VirtualBox, if not already running.
5.  Start whichever virtual machine originally triggered the problem
(e.g., the link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance]); it should now be
gone.

19. Download a ZIP file of the link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15-ovf.zip. That ZIP
file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
20. Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder
named *cs50-appliance-3* with two files within (*cs50-appliance-3.ovf*
and *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk*). Odds are that folder's in your
*Downloads* folder, unless you saved it elsewhere. Do not double-click
*cs50-appliance-3.ovf* or *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk*.

The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this
package.  This may indicate a problem with this package.  The error code
is 2869.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This problem generally indicates that VirtualBox's installer wasn't run
as an "administrator." To resolve this problem:

1.  Hit image:Windows.jpg[Windows.jpg,title="image"]-*R* on your
keyboard (i.e., hold the Windows key, then hit *R*) to open a *Run*
prompt.
2.  Input *ncpa.cpl* to the right of *Open*, then hit Enter.
3.  A window entitled *Network Connections* should then appear,
containing an icon called *Wireless Network Connection* and/or *Local
Area Connection* (or similar).
* If using wireless Internet, right-click *Wireless Network Connection*
(or similar), then choose *Properties* from the menu that appears. A
window entitled *Wireless Network Connection Properties* (or similar)
should then appear.
* If using wired Internet, right-click *Local Area Connection* (or
similar), then choose *Properties* from the menu that appears. A window
entitled *Local Area Connection Properties* (or similar) should then
appear.
4.  Inside of that window should be a list of items, some (or all) of
which are checked. If *VirtualBox Bridged Networking Driver* appears in
the list, single-click it to highlight it, then click *Uninstall*.
5.  If prompted if you are *sure you want to uninstall*, click *Yes*.
6.  Click *Close*.
7.  Proceed to reinstall VirtualBox per link:#_windows[the directions
above]. *Be sure to run the installer as an administrator.*

Let sysadmins@cs50.net know if VirtualBox's installer still fails,
despite these steps!
