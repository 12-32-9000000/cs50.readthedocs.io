Here's how to install the link:../../CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] using
VMware Player for link:#_installation[Windows].


== Installation

1.  Download VMware Player for free from
http://www.vmware.com/products/player/.
2.  Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your
*Downloads* folder) in order launch VMware Player's installer.
3.  If a window entitled *User Account Control*, click *Yes*.
4.  A window entitled *VMware Player Setup* should appear. Click *Next*.
5.  When prompted to select a *Destination Folder*, click *Next*.
6.  When prompted about *Shortcuts*, click *Next*. (Uncheck *Desktop*
and/or *Start Menu Programs folder* if you'd like.)
7.  When prompted to *Perform the Requested Operations*, click
*Continue*.
8.  Once you see *Setup Wizard Complete*, click *Restart Now* if
prompted, else *Continue*.
9.  Download a ZIP file of the link:../../CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15-vmx.zip. That ZIP
file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
10. Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder
named *cs50-appliance-3* with two files within
(*cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* and *cs50-appliance-3.vmx*). Odds are
that folder's in your *Downloads* folder, unless you saved it elsewhere.
Do not double-click *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* or
*cs50-appliance-3.vmx*.
11. Drag that *cs50-appliance-3* folder somewhere safe, where you won't
accidentally delete it. Do not leave it in your *Downloads* folder.
12. Launch VMware Player, as by single- or double-clicking its icon,
wherever it was installed.
13. If prompted with *Software Updates*, click *Download and Install*.
Else select *Help > Software Updates*, then click *Check for Updates*.
Update and relaunch VMware Player as needed.
14. Select *File > Open a Virtual Machine...*. Navigate your way to that
*cs50-appliance-3* folder (wherever you moved it for safe-keeping),
highlight the *cs50-appliance-3* (or *cs50-appliance-3.vmx*) file
within, and click *Open*. Then click VMware Fusion's â–¶ button to start
up the appliance.
