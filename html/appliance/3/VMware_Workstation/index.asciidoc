Here's how to install the link:../../CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] using
VMware Workstation for link:#_installation[Windows].


== Installation

1.  Download VMware Workstation as follows:
* If you're a student at Harvard,
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dHoyMG5LNTgxeGFhakNaaE9CdTlkbWc6MQ[apply
for the VMware Academic Program] (VMAP) in order to obtain a username
and password with which you can download VMware Workstation for free
from http://vmap.cs50.net/, along with a serial number.
* If you're not a student at Harvard, you can download a 30-day trial of
VMware Workstation from http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/.
After 30 days, you'll need to http://www.vmware.com/a/buylink/9[purchase
a license].
2.  Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your
*Downloads* folder) in order launch VMware Workstation's installer.
3.  If a window entitled *User Account Control*, click *Yes*.
4.  A window entitled *VMware Workstation Setup* should appear. Click
*Next*.
5.  When prompted to *Choose the setup type*, click the icon to the left
of *Typical*.
6.  When prompted to select a *Destination Folder*, click *Next*.
7.  When prompted about *Software Updates*, ensure that *Check for
product updates on startup* is checked, then click *Next*.

12. Download a ZIP file of the link:../../CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-vmx.zip. That ZIP
file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
13. Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder
named *cs50-appliance-3* with two files within
(*cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* and *cs50-appliance-3.vmx*). Odds are

icon, wherever it was installed.

Else select *Help > Software Updates*, then click *Check for Updates*.

17. Select *File > Open...*. Navigate your way to that
*cs50-appliance-3* folder (wherever you moved it for safe-keeping),
highlight the *cs50-appliance-3* (or *cs50-appliance-3.vmx*) file
within, and click *Open*. Then click VMware Fusion's â–¶ button to start
up the appliance.
