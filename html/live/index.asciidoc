= CS50 Live

Thanks for taking the time to submit a video to CS50 Live for us to use on our broadcast!  Here are some simple steps to help ensure that your video is what we need.

.Recommendations
* Please make sure you shoot in Landscape Mode, NOT portrait mode

* Make sure there is plenty of light on you, be careful that you are not silhouetted. (Don't shoot in front of a window!)
* Make sure it is reasonably quiet (Turn off TV, Radio, etc)
* Upload the highest quality possible (we prefer HD)!  While we can work with any file, higher resolution devices will look better
* Watch your video once complete, make sure it looks and sounds good to you

.Uploading
Once satisfied, upload your video to a public video sharing service link:http://youtube.com[YouTube], link:http://vimeo.com[Vimeo], or link:http://dropbox.com[Dropbox] and send us the link at mailto:live@cs50.net[live@cs50.net]!
