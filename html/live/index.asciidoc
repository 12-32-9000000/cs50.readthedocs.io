= CS50 Live

Thanks for taking the time to submit a video to CS50 Live for us to use on our broadcast!  Here are some simple steps to help ensure that your video is what we need.

.Recommendations
* Please make sure you shoot in *landscape* mode, NOT portrait mode

* Make sure there is plenty of light on you, be careful that you are not silhouetted. (Don't shoot in front of a window!)
* Make sure it is reasonably quiet (Turn off TV, Radio, etc)
* Try to keep your recording duration to about 10 seconds
* It is ideal if you ask your question in the form of "Hi, my name is \______\______ from \______\______. My question is..."
* Upload the highest quality possible (we prefer HD)!  While we can work with any file, higher resolution devices will look better
* Watch your video once complete, make sure it looks and sounds good to you

.Uploading
Once satisfied, upload your video to a public video sharing service such as link:http://youtube.com[YouTube], link:http://vimeo.com[Vimeo], or link:http://dropbox.com[Dropbox] and send us the link at mailto:live@cs50.net[live@cs50.net], be sure to *include* your *Name* (or what we should call you) and *Country* and optionally any other details you think we might be interested in (age, occupation) in the email!
