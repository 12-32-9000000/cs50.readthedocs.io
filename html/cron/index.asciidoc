Cron is a utility found on most Linux systems that allows you to execute
commands on a schedule (e.g., daily at midnight). Those commands can be
C programs, PHP scripts, or any executable at all. A scheduled command
is called a "cron job." If your cron job is a script, written in an
interpreted language be sure that the file's first line is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)[shebang]. For instance, if
your script is written in PHP, its first two lines should be:

`#!/usr/bin/php` +
`u``), as by executing:`

`chmod u+x script`

And if it is written in PHP, be sure not to give it a `.php` file
extension if lives somewhere in `~/public_html/`, lest someone else be
able to execute it via a browser; name it something like `script`, not
`script.php`.

How to Schedule a Cron Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Visit https://cloud.cs50.net/usermin.
2.  Log in with your cloud username and password if prompted.
3.  Click *Others* at top-left.
4.  Click *Scheduled Cron Jobs* at top-left.
5.  Click *Create a new scheduled cron job*.
6.  Under *Job Details*, ensure that *Yes* is checked to the right of
*Active?*, then input the full path to the script you want executed
(e.g., `/home/jharvard/public_html/project/script`) to the right of
*Command*. Be sure to test the path first: SSH to the cloud and try
executing at your prompt it via copy/paste. If you see something like
*No such file or directory*, it's not the right path!
7.  Under *When to execute*, specify a schedule.
8.  Under *Date range to execute*, specify a schedule.
9.  Click *Create*.

For instance, if John Harvard `jharvard` wants to schedule
`~/public_html/project/script` to run daily at midnight, he should
schedule a cron job per the below.
