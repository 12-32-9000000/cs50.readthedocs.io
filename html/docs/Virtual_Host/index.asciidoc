title: Virtual_Host
---

Because modern browsers include a `Host:` header in their HTTP requests,
a server can host multiple websites at a single IP address by examining
that header to determine which website was requested. A website that
lives alongside others is called a "virtual host" (otherwise known as a
"vhost").

By default on the cloud, a website lives in
`/home/username/public_html/` and is accessible at
`<nowiki>http://cloud.cs50.net/~username/</nowiki>`, where `username` is
your own username. Suffice it to say that's not the sexiest URL, so some
students like to buy a domain name (e.g.,
`<nowiki>isawyouharvard.com</nowiki>`) and then "map" that domain name
to their cloud account.

In order to make this happen, you need to:

1.  link:#How_to_Buy_a_Domain_Name[Buy a domain name].
2.  link:#How_to_Configure_DNS[Configure DNS for your domain] so that
your domain name "resolves" to the cloud's IP adddress.
3.  link:#Inform_CS50_of_Your_Domain_Name[Inform CS50 of your domain
name].
4.  link:#How_to_Start_Implementing_Your_Website[Implement your website]
in your cloud account in
`/home/username/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/html/`, where `username` is
your own username and `isawyouharvard.com` is your own domain name.

Note that you will _not_ be able to use SSL with your own domain name
(without users' seeing warnings about "invalid certificates") because
SSL requires a unique IP address per domain. (If you want users to be
able to log in securely, best to use link:CS50 ID[CS50 ID].) And if you
want to keep your website online after term's end, you'll need to
migrate your site to a commercial web host or to
http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/[HCS], as per link:Life_after_50[life after
50].

How to Buy a Domain Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a preferred
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar[registrar], you're
welcome to buy your domain name from anywhere. Just be sure that the
registrar allows you to configure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System[DNS] records for your
domain.

If you've never bought a domain name before, allow us to recommend
http://www.godaddy.com/[Go Daddy], if only because CS50 itself uses them
and knows their interface best. Beware Go Daddy's constant attempts to
upsell you. No need to pay for email accounts, for hosting, for privacy
(unless you want it), or for anything other than the domain name itself.
Fight your way to the checkout!

How to Configure DNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the sake of discussion, assume that your domain name is
`isawyouharvard.com`.

Once you've bought your domain name from Go Daddy or someone else, you
then need to configure:

* an "A record" for `isawyouharvard.com` (usually abbreviated `@`) so
that it resolves to *140.247.63.239*
* a "CNAME record" for `www.isawyouharvard.com` (usually abbreviated
`www`) so that it resolves to `isawyouharvard.com` (usually abbreviated
*@*)

If you bought your domain name from Go Daddy, odds are you'll find that
your domain name already has one A record and several CNAME records by
default. If so, it should suffice to edit the default A record so that
it resolves to *140.247.63.239* instead of Go Daddy's default IP
address, per Go Daddy's instructions for
http://help.godaddy.com/article/680#arecs[Adding or Editing A Records].
You should find that you already have a CNAME record for `www` that
resolves to `@`; if not, follow Go Daddy's instructions for
http://help.godaddy.com/article/680#cnames[Adding or editing CNAME
Records].

Ultimately, you should have only one A record for `isawyouharvard.com`,
as in the screenshot below.

And you should have only one CNAME record for `www.isawyouharvard.com`,
as in the screenshot below.

How to Start Implementing Your Website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the sake of discussion, assume that your username is `username` and
your domain name is `isawyouharvard.com`.

For your domain name to work, your website must live in
`<nowiki>/home/username/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/html/</nowiki>`.
Recall that `/home/username/` is just the path to your home directory,
usually abbreviated with a tilde (`~`). And so, to start implementing
your website, you'll likely want to SSH to `cloud.cs50.net` and execute
commands like the below.

`mkdir ~/vhosts/` +
`chmod 711 ~/vhosts/` +
 +
`mkdir ~/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/` +
`chmod 711 ~/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/` +
 +
`mkdir ~/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/html/` +
`chmod 711 ~/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/html/` +
 +
`cd ~/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/html/` +
 +
`nano index.php`

After saving `index.php`, you should immediately be able to visit it on
the Web at either of

*
`<nowiki>http://cloud.cs50.net/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com.php</nowiki>`
* `<nowiki>http://cloud.cs50.net/vhosts/isawyouharvard.com/</nowiki>`

where `isawyouharvard.com` is your own domain name. Those aren't URLs
that you should advertise; they're simply "aliases" that we configure
for you just in case it takes a few hours (or days) for your actual
domain name to start working. Because of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_propagation#Record_caching[caching],
it sometimes takes a while for browsers to realize that a website's IP
address has changed.

Once your domain's DNS records have propagated throughout the Internet
(or at least to your own laptop), you should be able to visit your
website at any of

* `<nowiki>http://isawyouharvard.com.php</nowiki>`
* `<nowiki>http://isawyouharvard.com/</nowiki>`
* `<nowiki>http://www.isawyouharvard.com.php</nowiki>`
* `<nowiki>http://www.isawyouharvard.com/</nowiki>`

domain name], link:#How_to_Configure_DNS[configured DNS], and

Email help@cs50.net if you run into trouble; be sure to mention your
username and domain name in your email.
