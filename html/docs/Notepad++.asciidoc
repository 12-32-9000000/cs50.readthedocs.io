Notepad++ is a text editor for Windows that you can download from
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download[http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download].
Once downloaded, run the `.exe` file by double-clicking its icon and
proceed to install the text editor.

Because Notepad++ comes with built-in support for SFTP, you can use it
to edit files that actually live on `cloud.cs50.net` (or any other
server that supports SFTP.

Note that to actually compile or execute programs, you'll still want to
SSH to the cloud with PuTTY.

Opening a File on the Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Launch Notepad++ by double-clicking its icon in your Start Menu.
2.  Select *Plugins → NppFTP*, and check *Show NppFTP Window* if not
already checked. You should then see *NppFTP - Disconnected* in the
program's top-right corner.
3.  In that *NppFTP* window at top-right, click the gear icon in that
window and select *Profile settings* if you've not yet created a profile
for the cloud. In the window that appears, click *Add new*, then input
*cloud.cs50.net* for *Hostname*, select *SFTP* for *Connection type*,
input *22* for *Port* (if not already there), input your username for
*Username*, input your password for *Password* unless you're not on your
own computer, in which case you should instead check *Ask for password*.
*If you check that box, beware that you'll later be prompted to input
your password as cleartext; it won't be displayed as bullets.* Then
click *Close*.
4.  In that same *NppFTP* window at top-right, click the *(Dis)connect*
icon to the left of the gear icon. Select your cloud profile from the
menu that appears. You should see the contents of your home directory in
the window that appears. Ignore (and do not delete) any directories that
begin with a dot (`.`).
5.  Navigate your way to the file that you would like to open, then
double-click it. The file should open.
6.  Edit the file however you'd like. Anytime you select *File → Save*
or hit ctrl-s, the file will be saved directly to the cloud.
