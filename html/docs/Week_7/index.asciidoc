I have always taught a section "for those less comfortable". Here is my
"cheat sheet" for Media:CheatSheet7.pdf[Week 7]. 2010 was the first year
I made these, and I intend to hand them out (1) after section (2) only
to those people who actually attended. These are intended as a two-page
capsule summary of important topics. The goal is to refresh students'
minds on these for quiz-preparation purposes, ie. to remember the syntax
of a loop. If other TFs intend to use them, please keep the attribution
to me, and just send me an email saying that you are using them. These
were prepared using LaTeX.

And here's some Media:Week7lloyd.zip[sample code] *(zip)* that
illustrates the concepts covered in that cheat sheet. Note that within
the .zip is a PDF of all of the code therein.
