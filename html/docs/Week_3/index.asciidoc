*Fall '10*:

:* Less comfy Media:Week3.ppt[Powerpoint Slides]!

:** Media:RcaoWeek3.zip[Source code]

:** Media:RcaoGDBcmd.pdf[GDB Cheat Sheet] (as a pdf!)

*Fall '09*:

:* Less comfy Media:Section2.doc[Section Lesson Plan]

:** Topics: Recursion, Call Stack, Complexity/Efficiency, Sorting, GDB!
(Not quite the same as the topic list for this year...)

:** Again, before I switched to slides. Will be underwhelming. There's a
gdb cheat sheet on page 5/6, though! Recursion practice on page 6/6.

:* Quiz 0 Review Media:SearchnSort.ppt[Slides on Search & Sorting] (and
Complexity)

:** Animation's a bit choppy (esp with the exclamation points)....

I have always taught a section "for those less comfortable". Here is my
"cheat sheet" for Media:CheatSheet3_1.pdf[Week 3]. 2010 was the first
year I made these, and I intend to hand them out (1) after section (2)
only to those people who actually attended. These are intended as a
two-page capsule summary of important topics. The goal is to refresh
students' minds on these for quiz-preparation purposes, ie. to remember
the syntax of a loop. If other TFs intend to use them, please keep the
attribution to me, and just send me an email saying that you are using
them. These were prepared using LaTeX.

I also wrote up some sample code of the game Media:Tictac.pdf[Tic Tac
Toe] to show how a 2D array may be used in practice (and also for fun!)
