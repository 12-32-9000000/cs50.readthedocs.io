'''We haven't done much testing with Parallels, so please consider these instructions unofficial for now!'''

Here's how to install the [[CS50_Appliance_17|CS50 Appliance]] using Parallels for [[#Installation|Mac OS]].

== Installation ==

# Download a ZIP file of the [[CS50_Appliance_17|CS50 Appliance]] at http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance50/17/i386/appliance50-17-9-vmx.zip ([http://mirror.cs50.net.s3.amazonaws.com/appliance50/17/i386/appliance50-17-9-vmx.zip?torrent torrent]).  That ZIP file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
# Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder named '''appliance50-17''' with two files within ('''appliance50-17.vmdk''' and '''appliance50-17.vmx''').  Odds are that folder's in your '''Downloads''' folder, unless you saved it elsewhere. Do <u>not</u> double-click '''appliance50-17.vmdk''' or '''appliance50-17.vmx'''.
# Drag that '''appliance50-17''' folder somewhere safe, where you won't accidentally delete it.  Do <u>not</u> leave it in your '''Downloads''' folder.
# Launch Parallels, as by double-clicking its icon, which should be in your '''Applications''' folder.  
# Select '''File > Open''' and navigate your way to that '''appliance50-17''' folder and open the '''appliance50-17.vmx''' file within.  
# When prompted to convert, click '''Convert'''.  
# When prompted to '''Find Directory''', choose a location for the converted appliance, then click '''Choose'''. 
# If warned that Parallels "failed to detect the operating system," simply click '''Yes'''.  Once converted, click '''OK'''.
# Click '''Click to start''' to start up the appliance.  If you see a black-and-white screen entitled '''GNU GRUB''', no need to do anything; the appliance will continue to boot after a few seconds!
# Once the appliance has started, select '''Virtual Machine > Install Parallels Tools...'''.  (That menu is outside of the appliance.)  Click '''Continue''' if prompted.
# Within the appliance, [[CS50_Appliance_17#How_to_Open_a_Terminal|open a terminal window]] and execute:<pre>sudo vmware-uninstall-tools.pl</pre>
# Then execute:<pre>sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media</pre>
# Then execute:<pre>sudo /media/install --install-unattended-with-deps</pre>. That command may take a few minutes to run.
# Select '''Menu > Log Out > Restart'''.  

Once the appliance starts, you should be all set!
