Here's how to install the [[CS50_Appliance_17|CS50 Appliance]] using VMware Fusion for [[#Installation|Mac OS]].

== Installation ==

# Download a term-long trial of VMware Fusion as follows, courtesy of our friends at [http://www.vmware.com/ VMware]:
## Visit <html><a href="https://x.cs50.net/2013/software" target="_blank">https://x.cs50.net/2013/software</a></html> and click the link for '''VMware Fusion'''.
## You should find yourself at VMware's site.  Click the '''Create an Account''' tab, complete the form that appears (using the same email address with which you registered for edX), then click '''Free Trial'''.
## Check your email for further instructions from VMware (which may take a few minutes to arrive).  If an email from them doesn't arrive within 10 minutes, try one or more of these suggestions:
##* Click '''Resend Email'''.
##* Check your junk or spam mail folder.
##* Add <tt>donotreply@vmware.com</tt> to your email contacts list or whitelist.
##* Ask your IT department to add <tt>donotreply@vmware.com</tt> to their email whitelist.
##* Try creating an account with another email address.
## Upon receiving an email from VMware, click the '''activate''' link or '''Activate Now''' button therein.
## If prompted for your password, input the password you chose when creating an account, then click '''Continue'''.
## Highlight and copy the '''LICENSE KEY''' that appears, then paste it somewhere safe.  (It will be an alphanumeric string of the form #####-#####-#####-#####-#####.)
## Click the '''Download''' button on the page that appears to download VMware Fusion.  (It may take a few minutes or hours.)
# Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your '''Downloads''' folder) in order to "mount" VMware Fusion's icon on your desktop.  
# A window should open.  Drag the '''VMware Fusion''' (or '''VMware Fusion.app''') icon in that window to your '''Applications''' folder.
# Download a ZIP file of the [[CS50_Appliance_17|CS50 Appliance]] at http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance50/17/i386/appliance50-17-9-vmx.zip ([http://mirror.cs50.net.s3.amazonaws.com/appliance50/17/i386/appliance50-17-9-vmx.zip?torrent torrent]).  That ZIP file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
# Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder named '''appliance50-17''' with two files within ('''appliance50-17.vmdk''' and '''appliance50-17.vmx''').  Odds are that folder's in your '''Downloads''' folder, unless you saved it elsewhere. Do <u>not</u> double-click '''appliance50-17.vmdk''' or '''appliance50-17.vmx'''.
# Drag that '''appliance50-17''' folder somewhere safe, where you won't accidentally delete it.  Do <u>not</u> leave it in your '''Downloads''' folder.
# Launch VMware Fusion, as by double-clicking its icon, which should be in your '''Applications''' folder.  If prompted with a '''Software License Agreement''', click '''Agree'''.  If prompted for '''Licensing''', paste in your license key, then click '''OK'''.  If prompted to '''Create New''', '''Convert VM''', or '''Migrate PC''', simply click '''Skip'''.  
# Ensure that you have version 5.0.1 or later of VMware Fusion, as by selecting '''VMware Fusion > Check for Updates...'''.  Update and relaunch VMware Fusion as needed.
# Select '''File > Open...'''.  Navigate your way to that '''appliance50-17''' folder (wherever you moved it for safe-keeping), highlight the '''appliance50-17.vmx''' file within, and click '''Open'''.  
# Click VMware Fusion's &#x25B6; button to start up the appliance.  If prompted to "upgrade this virtual machine," click '''Upgrade'''.

The appliance should then boot!  If you see a black-and-white screen entitled '''GNU GRUB''', no need to do anything; the appliance will continue to boot after a few seconds!
