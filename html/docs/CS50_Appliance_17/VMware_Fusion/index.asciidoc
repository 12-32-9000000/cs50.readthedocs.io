Here's how to install the link:..[CS50 Appliance] using
VMware Fusion for link:#Installation[Mac OS].

[[]]
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Download a term-long trial of VMware Fusion as follows, courtesy of
our friends at http://www.vmware.com/[VMware]:
1.  Visit https://x.cs50.net/2013/software
and click the link for *VMware Fusion*.
2.  You should find yourself at VMware's site. Click the *Create an
Account* tab, complete the form that appears (using the same email
address with which you registered for edX), then click *Free Trial*.
3.  Check your email for further instructions from VMware (which may
take a few minutes to arrive). If an email from them doesn't arrive
within 10 minutes, try one or more of these suggestions:
* Click *Resend Email*.
* Check your junk or spam mail folder.
* Add `donotreply@vmware.com` to your email contacts list or whitelist.
* Ask your IT department to add `donotreply@vmware.com` to their email
whitelist.
* Try creating an account with another email address.
4.  Upon receiving an email from VMware, click the *activate* link or
*Activate Now* button therein.
5.  If prompted for your password, input the password you chose when
creating an account, then click *Continue*.
6.  Highlight and copy the *LICENSE KEY* that appears, then paste it
somewhere safe. (It will be an alphanumeric string of the form
#####-#####-#####-#####-#####.)
7.  Click the *Download* button on the page that appears to download
VMware Fusion. (It may take a few minutes or hours.)
2.  Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your
*Downloads* folder) in order to "mount" VMware Fusion's icon on your
desktop.
3.  A window should open. Drag the *VMware Fusion* (or *VMware
Fusion.app*) icon in that window to your *Applications* folder.
4.  Download a ZIP file of the link:..[CS50 Appliance] at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance50/17/i386/appliance50-17-9-vmx.zip
(http://mirror.cs50.net.s3.amazonaws.com/appliance50/17/i386/appliance50-17-9-vmx.zip?torrent[torrent]).
That ZIP file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
5.  Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder
named *appliance50-17* with two files within (*appliance50-17.vmdk* and
*appliance50-17.vmx*). Odds are that folder's in your *Downloads*
folder, unless you saved it elsewhere. Do not double-click
*appliance50-17.vmdk* or *appliance50-17.vmx*.
6.  Drag that *appliance50-17* folder somewhere safe, where you won't
accidentally delete it. Do not leave it in your *Downloads* folder.
7.  Launch VMware Fusion, as by double-clicking its icon, which should
be in your *Applications* folder. If prompted with a *Software License
Agreement*, click *Agree*. If prompted for *Licensing*, paste in your
license key, then click *OK*. If prompted to *Create New*, *Convert VM*,
or *Migrate PC*, simply click *Skip*.
8.  Ensure that you have version 5.0.1 or later of VMware Fusion, as by
selecting *VMware Fusion > Check for Updates...*. Update and relaunch
VMware Fusion as needed.
9.  Select *File > Open...*. Navigate your way to that *appliance50-17*
folder (wherever you moved it for safe-keeping), highlight the
*appliance50-17.vmx* file within, and click *Open*.
10. Click VMware Fusion's â–¶ button to start up the appliance. If
prompted to "upgrade this virtual machine," click *Upgrade*.

The appliance should then boot! If you see a black-and-white screen
entitled *GNU GRUB*, no need to do anything; the appliance will continue
to boot after a few seconds!
