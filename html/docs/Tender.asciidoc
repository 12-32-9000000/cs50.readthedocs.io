__FORCETOC__ http://help.cs50.net/[help.cs50.net] is powered by
http://tenderapp.com/[Tender Support], which is a "simple helpdesk
application." Not only does http://help.cs50.net/[help.cs50.net] now
serve as the course's "bulletin board," emails sent to help@cs50.net are
also routed to the site and queued in an invisible, private category
that only staff can see. Tender calls threads "discussions," but you can
also think of them as "tickets." To close a ticket, you "resolve" it in
Tenderspeak.

Quickstart Guide
----------------

If you've not logged into http://help.cs50.net/[help.cs50.net] yet, do
so and let sysadmins@cs50.net know that you have so that we can promote
you to "support staff." You can still respond to students' questions
before you're support staff, but you won't be able to see the staff's
"dashboard" with which you can resolve tickets and more.

Once you've been promoted to support staff, you should find yourself at
http://help.cs50.net/dashboard[help.cs50.net/dashboard] by default
anytime you log in. To get there manually, click

CS50 Support

in the site's top-left corner. Odds are the dashboard will resemble the
below:

image:Dashboard.png[Dashboard.png,title="image"]

The *4* to the right of *Pending* means that we had 4 tickets in our
inbox when I took this particular screenshot. Suppose that you click the
first of those issues (*Sensor board not recognized by Mac... help!*),
you should see a screen like the below:

image:Discussion.png[Discussion.png,title="image"]

If you decide to field the ticket, click *ACKNOWLEDGE UPDATE* in the
blue bar atop the post so that it no longer appears as *Pending*, lest
someone else start replying to the same ticket:

Then proceed to write your response. You should find the interface
fairly self-explanatory, but take particular note of these features:

* Under *Reply to this discussion*, there's a checkbox labeled *Only
show this comment to our staff*. If you'd like to comment on this
discussion for other staff's eyes (e.g., because you're not sure of the
answer and want to ask someone), do so by checking that box.
* On the righthand side of this screen is a button labeled *MAKE
PRIVATE*. If you decide that this discussion should really be between us
and the student only (because they've shared too much code or you want
to reply with too much detail), simply click that button.
* On the righthand side of the screen is a button labeled *SUBSCRIBE TO
UPDATES*. If unsure how to answer a question and want to be sure you see
others' replies, click that button to subscribe via email to updates. If
you want someone else to see any replies (e.g., a student who's
struggling with the same question), click *Others* just above that
button, input his or her email address, then click *NOTIFY*.
* Also on the righthand side is a link labeled *Resolve the discussion*.
Click that link if an additional comment in the thread isn't warranted
and you want to signify to fellow staff that the issue is indeed
resolved.
* To add a comment to the discussion and resolve it at the same time,
click the button labeled *COMMENT & CLOSE* instead of that labeled just
*COMMENT* after typing your reply.
* Click *Formatting help* for a summary of common formatting tricks. Or
see the section on link:#Markdown[Markdown] below.

If you determine that a discussion is best answered by
mailto:heads@cs50.net[heads@] or mailto:sysadmins@cs50.net[sysadmins@],
click *ADD TO QUEUE* in the blue bar atop the discussion and then click
the team's name. If you determine that a discussion was mis-categorized,
click *CHANGE CATEGORY* in the blue bar and then select the better fit.
If you determine that a student has posted too much code, you're welcome
to click *EDIT* or, per the link:#Quickstart_Guide[Quickstart Guide],
*MAKE PRIVATE*. Only in rare cases (e.g., offensive) should you consider
clicking *REMOVE*, but even then, probably best to *MAKE PRIVATE* and
escalate to mailto:heads@cs50.net[heads@] for review.

Markdown
--------

Tender supports
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Markdown], which is a
wiki-like syntax with which you can format your comments. Odds are
you'll find these tricks the most useful:

image:Formatting.png[Formatting.png,title="image"]

You can see this same window by clicking *Formatting help* beneath any
discussion. Know that, for multiple lines of code, it's probably
simplest (and prettiest) to surround them with `&lt;pre&gt;` and
`&lt;/pre&gt;`.

Email Preferences
-----------------

You can actually interact with http://help.cs50.net/[help.cs50.net]
almost entirely via email. To receive notifications

* of discussions you're involved with
* when someone starts a new discussion
* of all discussions in a particular category

click your name in the top-right corner of any page, then click the
button labeled *EDIT YOUR PROFILE*, also at top-right. Under *Email
Preferences* can you sign up for notifications.

In the footer of the emails you'll start to receive will be:

`You can use commands on a new line at the top of this email.` +
`Available commands: #resolve #acknowledge #spam #delete #queue #notify #ignore #public #private` +
`More information: `https://help.tenderapp.com/faqs/email-integration/commands[https://help.tenderapp.com/faqs/email-integration/commands[`https://help.tenderapp.com/faqs/email-integration/commands`]]

As the footer suggests, you can execute all sorts of commands via email;
just take care that any command (even if preceded or followed by your
reply to a student) is on a line of its own.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

Odds are you'll find these commands the most useful, but more
https://help.tenderapp.com/faqs/email-integration/commands[commands] do
exist:

* `#resolve`: resolves a discussion (i.e., closes a ticket)
* `#acknowledge`: removes a discussion from the staff's inbox without
actually marking it "resolved." Appropriate if you want to close a
ticket for which it doesn't make sense, semantically, to mark it as
"resolved" (e.g., because no question was actually asked).
* `#private`: flags the discussion as private. Appropriate if the
student posted too much detail or if you want to reply with private
details (e.g., the student's default password).
* `#queue heads`: queues the discussion for
mailto:heads@cs50.net[heads@]
* `#queue sysadmins`: queues the discussion for
mailto:sysadmins@cs50.net[sysadmins@]
