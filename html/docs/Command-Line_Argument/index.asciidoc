title: Command-Line_Argument
---

A command-line argument is an argument that is passed to a program when
it is called at the command line (hence the name). For example, if your
program's name is `foo`, you might pass it `bar` and `baz` as two
command-line arguments like so:

-------------
./foo bar baz
-------------

As you can see, command-line arguments are separated by spaces. If one
of your command-line arguments itself contains a space, you'll need to
encapsulate it in quotation marks like so:

---------------
./foo "bar baz"
---------------

Here, `bar baz` is passed as a single command-line argument whereas
earlier it was passed as two separate command-line arguments.

A program can access the command-line arguments it's been passed via
link:../argv[argv] within `main`.
