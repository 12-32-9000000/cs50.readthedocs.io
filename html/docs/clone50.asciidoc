title: clone50

While using the link:CS50_Appliance_2.3[CS50 appliance] or while logged
in to the link:Cloud[CS50 cloud], you can recover old submissions using
the `clone50` command, which is the inverse of `submit50`. For example,
in a terminal, run:

----------------
mkdir  ~/pset5
clone50  ~/pset5
----------------

The latter command will ask you questions similar to those `submit50`
asks. If you specify the `pset5` repository, for example, it will put a
copy of that repository into `~/pset5`.

To avoid accidental overwriting, the `clone50` command expects to be
given an empty directory to clone into. It will only clone one
repository at a time.
