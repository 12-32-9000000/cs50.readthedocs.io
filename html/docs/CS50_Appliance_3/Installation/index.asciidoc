'''Once installed, it's not uncommon for the appliance to take 1 &#8211; 2 minutes to boot.  But if, once at John Harvard's desktop, the appliance still feels unbearably slow, you might need to enable [[Hardware Virtualization|hardware virtualization]] on your computer if it's a PC running Windows or Linux.  (Hardware virtualization should be enabled by default on any Intel-based Mac manufactured in the past few years.)  Even with hardware virtualization enabled, though, virtual machines might still feel slow if your computer is a few years old, has a CPU that's only 1GHz or so, or has only 1GB or so of RAM.'''
