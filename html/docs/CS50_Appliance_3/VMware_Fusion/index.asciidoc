Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Download VMware Fusion as follows:
* If you're a student or course staff member at Harvard,
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dHoyMG5LNTgxeGFhakNaaE9CdTlkbWc6MQ[apply
for the VMware Academic Program] (VMAP) in order to obtain a username
and password with which you can download VMware Fusion for free from
http://vmap.cs50.net/, along with a serial number.
* If you're not a student at Harvard, you can download a 30-day trial of
VMware Fusion from http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html.
After 30 days, you'll need to
http://www.vmware.com/a/buylink/10[purchase a license] for $49.99.
2.  Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your
*Downloads* folder) in order to "mount" VMware Fusion's icon on your
desktop.
3.  A window should open. Drag the *VMware Fusion* (or *VMware
Fusion.app*) icon in that window to your *Applications* folder.
4.  Download a ZIP file of the link:CS50_Appliance_3[CS50 Appliance] at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15-vmx.zip. That ZIP
file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.
5.  Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file, and you should have a folder
named *cs50-appliance-3* with two files within
(*cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* and *cs50-appliance-3.vmx*). Odds are
that folder's in your *Downloads* folder, unless you saved it elsewhere.
Do not double-click *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* or
*cs50-appliance-3.vmx*.
6.  Drag that *cs50-appliance-3* folder somewhere safe, where you won't
accidentally delete it. Do not leave it in your *Downloads* folder.
7.  Launch VMware Fusion, as by double-clicking its icon, which should
be in your *Applications* folder.
8.  Ensure that you have version 4.1.1 or later of VMware Fusion, as by
selecting *VMware Fusion > Check for Updates*. Update and relaunch
VMware Fusion as needed.
9.  Select *File > Open...*. Navigate your way to that
*cs50-appliance-3* folder (wherever you moved it for safe-keeping),
highlight the *cs50-appliance-3.vmx* file within, and click *Open*. Then
click VMware Fusion's â–¶ button to start up the appliance.
