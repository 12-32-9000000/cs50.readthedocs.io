title: CS50_Appliance_3
---

*This HOWTO is for version 3 of the CS50 Appliance.*

* *If following Spring 2012 of CS1, CS51, or CS164, you should use this
version of the appliance.*
* *If following https://www.cs50.net/[Fall 2011] of CS50, you should use
link:CS50 Appliance 2.3[version 2.3] of the appliance.*
* *If following http://cs50.tv/2010/fall/[Fall 2010] of CS50, you should
use link:CS50 Appliance 2.1[version 2.1] of the appliance.*
* *If following http://cs50.tv/2009/fall/[Fall 2009] of CS50, you should
use link:CS50 Appliance 1.4[version 1.4] instead.*

The CS50 Appliance is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machine] (VM) that
lets you "take" CS50 (and other courses!), even if you're not a student
at Harvard.

It's based on
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)[Fedora], a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux[Linux]-based
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system[operating system]. It's an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_appliance[appliance] in the sense
that we've preconfigured this VM for a specific purpose: CS50!

In other words, even if you're not a student in CS50, you can still play
along at home. The CS50 Appliance will let you compile source code from
https://www.cs50.net/lectures/[lectures] and implement
https://www.cs50.net/psets/[problem sets] without having to figure out
how to configure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection[GCC], etc.
yourself. Moreover, the CS50 Appliance lets you run Linux inside of a
window on your own computer, even if you're already running (some other
version of) Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, or Windows!

Incidentally, the appliance is always work in progress, so please
forgive any bugs!

Instructions
------------

[[]]
How to Install Appliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install the CS50 Appliance, you first need to install a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor[hypervisor], which is a program
that will let you run
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machines] on your
own computer, whether you run Mac OS, Windows, or Linux.

* If you have a *Mac*, we recommend that you follow:
** link:CS50_Appliance_3/VMware_Fusion[these instructions for VMware
Fusion] if you are a student at Harvard
** link:CS50_Appliance_3/VirtualBox[these instructions for VirtualBox]
if you are not a student at Harvard
* If you have a *PC running Windows*, we recommend that you follow:
** link:CS50_Appliance_3/VMware_Player[these instructions for VMware
Player]
* If you have a *PC running Linux*, we recommend that you follow:
** link:CS50_Appliance_3/VirtualBox[these instructions for VirtualBox]

Once installed, it's not uncommon for the appliance to take a minute or
so to boot. But if, once at John Harvard's desktop, the appliance still
feels unbearably slow, you might need to enable
link:Hardware Virtualization[hardware virtualization] on your computer
if it's a PC running Windows or Linux. (Hardware virtualization should
be enabled by default on any Intel-based Mac manufactured in the past
few years.) Even with hardware virtualization enabled, though, virtual
machines might still feel slow if your computer is a few years old, has
a CPU that's only 1GHz or so, or has only 1GB or so of RAM.

[[]]
How to Update Appliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest version of the CS50 Appliance is *3-15*. More precisely, the
"latest release of version 3 of the appliance is 3-15." To confirm that
you have 3-15, look in the appliance's bottom-right corner, where you
should see *3-15* in boldface. Alternatively, you can
link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[open a terminal] and execute

`version50`

which should report `3-15` as well.

If you do not have the latest version, you can update your appliance
either of two ways:

* Select *Menu > Administration > Software Update*, then click *Install
Updates* if any updates are available.
* link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[Open a terminal] and execute:
+
------------------
sudo yum -y update
------------------

Don't worry if you see

`  Updating   : cs50-appliance-3-15.i386`

or similar on the screen for a minute or more; it takes a while to
restart each of the appliance's services.

*Note that you cannot update from version 1.4, 2.1, or 2.3 of the
appliance to version 3. You must instead download 3-15, per the
link:#How_to_Install_Appliance[instructions] above. Thereafter, you'll
be able to update from 3-15 to future releases, per the two ways above.*

[[]]
How to Use Appliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing you should see when the appliance boots up is John
Harvard's desktop. (Oh, henceforth, you are
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_(clergyman)[John Harvard].
Your initial password is *crimson*. And here's
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BostonTrip-91.jpg[what you look
like].) Even though you might think of Linux as having only a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[command-line
interface],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface[graphical user
interfaces] do exist. We've installed
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce[Xfce], one of the most popular, for
you. However, we installed as few programs as possible to keep the
appliance small. You're welcome to install additional programs via *Menu
> Administration > Add/Remove Applications*.

[[]]
How to Change Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As much as you might not like being called John, *do not try to change
John Harvard's name or username*. Life will be simpler as John.

With that said, if you'd _really_ like to be yourself (or someone else
altogether), you're welcome to create a new account.
link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[Open a terminal] and execute

`sudo adduser --comment "Jane Harvard" --gid students --groups wheel janeh` +
`echo crimson | sudo passwd --stdin janeh` +
`echo -e "crimson\ncrimson" | sudo smbpasswd -a -s janeh`

where `Jane Harvard` is your desired name, `crimson` is your desired
password, and `janeh` is your desired username. Be sure not to overlook
the `\n` in the second command.

If you'd also like to start logging into the appliance automatically
under your new identity (instead of John Harvard's), execute

`sudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf`

and change `jharvard` to your own username. Then hit *ctrl-x*, then *y*,
then *Enter* to save and quit.

[[]]
How to Change Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can change your password in any of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Preferences > Password* and follow the on-screen
prompts.
* link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[Open a terminal] and execute: +
+
------
passwd
------

With that said, allow us to suggest that you not change John Harvard's
password if your own computer is already password-protected. (Life will
be simpler with *crimson*.) The appliance has been configured in such a
way that only someone with access to your computer (e.g., you) can
access the appliance. Even though the appliance can connect to the
Internet, the Internet cannot connect to the appliance.

[[]]
How to Change Language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*This feature may require Internet access.*

If English is not your native language, you may want to change the
appliance's default language. Some things will remain in English, but
you might find yourself more at home nonetheless. Select *Menu >
Administration > Language*, inputting your password if prompted. Select
your preferred language from the list that appears, then click *OK*. If
prompted, click *Import key*. You may need to wait for a bit as the
language is installed. Then link:#How_to_Restart_Appliance[restart the
appliance] and log back in.

[[]]
How to Change Keyboard Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a non-U.S. (or non-standard) keyboard, you may want (or
need!) to change your keyboard's layout as follows.

1.  Select *Menu > Settings > Keyboard*.
2.  Click *Layout*.
3.  Uncheck *Use system defaults*.
4.  Leave *Keyboard model* blank unless you have one of the keyboards
listed.
5.  Click *Add* down below *Keyboard layout*.
6.  Select your keyboard's layout (and variant, if any).
7.  Click *OK*.
8.  Ensure that your selection is now highlighted instead of *English
(US)*, then click *Close*.

[[]]
How to Change Time Zone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, you may want to
change the appliance's timezone. Select *Menu > Administration > Date &
Time*. Click the *Time Zone* tab, select the nearest city in your time
zone, then click *OK*, leaving *System clock uses UTC* checked.

[[]]
How to Open a Terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can open a terminal in any of these ways:

* Select *Menu > Programming > Terminal* or *Menu > Accessories >
Terminal*. You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`).
* Click Terminal's icon (a black square) in the appliance's bottom-left
corner. You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`).
* Right-click anywhere on your desktop and select *Open Terminal Here*.
You'll find yourself in `~/Desktop/`.
* Select *Menu > Programming > gedit* or *Menu > Accessories > gedit*.
You'll find yourself in your home directory (`~`) in gedit's bottom
panel.

No matter the approach you take, it's in the terminal window that you'll
be able to type commands like `cd`, `gcc`, `ls`, etc.

[[]]
How to SSH to Appliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you'd like to SSH to the appliance from your own computer (as with
Terminal on Mac OS or with PuTTY on Windows), you can SSH from your
computer to the appliance's IP address (which is displayed in the
appliance's bottom-right corner).

*Note that, for security's sake, you can SSH to the appliance as
`jharvard` but not as `root`.*

your screen, at which point a menu should appear. Click the second icon
from the right (which resembles two squares).

[[]]
How to Use phpMyAdmin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can access phpMyAdmin in either of these ways:

* Visit http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/ or http://w.x.y.z/phpMyAdmin/
(where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's IP address, which can be found in
the appliance's bottom-right corner) using Chrome within the appliance.
* Visit http://w.x.y.z/phpMyAdmin/ (where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's
IP address, which can be found in the appliance's bottom-right corner)
using your own computer's browser.

No matter the approach you take, log in as *jharvard* (or, if necessary,
*root*) with a password of *crimson* if prompted.

[[]]
How to Restore Snapshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every 10 minutes, the appliance take "snapshots" of source code in
`/home` just in case you accidentally delete something. (You can also
mitigate accidental deletions by
link:#How_to_Synchronize_Files_with_Dropbox[synchronizing with
Dropbox].)

Suppose that you just deleted `~/pset1/hello.c`. Odds are you'll find it
in the `minutely.0` or `minutely.1` snapshot, depending on the current
time, in which case you can recover it with

`cp /.snapshots/minutely.0/home/jharvard/pset1/hello.c ~/pset1`

or with

`cp /.snapshots/minutely.1/home/jharvard/pset1/hello.c ~/pset1`

in a link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[terminal]. If you need to recover an
earlier version, you can go further back in time via `minutely.2`,
`minutely.3`, or `minutely.4`. If you'd instead like to go back an hour
or so, you can start with `hourly.0`, followed by `hourly.1`,
`hourly.2`, and so on. Below are all of the intervals you can try.
Realize that the times only estimates, since the intervals' definitions
depend on the current time.

How to Enable Dropbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*This feature requires Internet access.*

To make it easier to back up files within the appliance automatically as
well as share them with your own computer(s), you can synchronize a
directory in John Harvard's account with
http://www.dropbox.com/features[Dropbox]. *If a student at Harvard, just
take care to respect the course's policies on academic honesty.*

Here's how to configure the appliance for Dropbox.

1.  link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[Open a terminal].
2.  Execute:
+
----------------
dropbox start -i
----------------
3.  You should be prompted to "download the proprietary daemon" (i.e.,
software); click *OK*. The software should proceed to download and
unpack.
4.  You should then be prompted to set up Dropbox.
* If you don't already have a Dropbox account, leave *I don't have a
Dropbox account* checked, then click *Next*. Create your Dropbox as
prompted.
* If you already have an Dropbox account, check *I already have a
Dropbox account*, then click *OK*. Log in as prompted.
5.  If prompted to upgrade your Dropbox, simply leave *2 GB* checked
(which is free) then click *Next*, unless you want to upgrade to a paid
account.
6.  If prompted to *Choose setup type*, leave *Typical* checked, then
click *Install*.
7.  If prompted to take a 5-step tour, click *Skip Tour*; its
screenshots won't match what you'll see in the appliance.
8.  When informed *That's it!*, uncheck *Open my Dropbox folder now*,
then click *Finish*.
9.  If prompted for your admin password, input *crimson* (unless you
changed your root password to something else). *Don't worry if you then
see an error about "wrong password."*

If you then execute

`dropbox status`

you should see:

`Idle`

If you then execute

`cd ~/Dropbox/` +
`ls`

you should your dropbox's files. Alternatively, you can select *Menu >
Dropbox*. If you just created an account, among them will be *Getting
Started.pdf*, *Photos*, and *Public*. You can browse those same files
(and any others you create) at https://www.dropbox.com/login. You can
even undelete files.

*Only those files and folders that you save in `~/Dropbox/` will be
synchronized with your Dropbox account.*

How to Transfer Files between Appliance and Your Computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you'd like to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol[SFTP] to the
appliance from your own computer (as with
http://cyberduck.ch/[Cyberduck] on Mac OS or with
http://winscp.net/eng/download.php[WinSCP] on Windows), you can SFTP
from your computer to *w.x.y.z* (where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's IP
address, which can be found in the appliance's bottom-right corner).

Alternatively, you can "mount" John Harvard's home directory (via a
protocol called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block[SMB],
otherwise known as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS[CIFS]) in a window
on your own desktop, to and from which you can drag and drop files.

How to Access Appliance from Another Computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*This feature is not supported on Harvard's campus.*

By default, you can access the appliance from your own computer via
*w.x.y.z* (where *w.x.y.z* is the appliance's IP address, which can be
found in the appliance's bottom-right corner). That IP address only
exists within the confines of your hypervisor, though, so, by default,
it's _not_ possible to access the appliance from other computers on your
LAN (i.e., home network).

However, the appliance also comes with a "bridged" network interface
(`eth2`) that you can activate manually. So long as your LAN supports
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP]
(which most home networks do), that interface will acquire an IP address
on your LAN, at which point you can access the appliance via HTTP or SSH
via _that_ IP from any computer on your LAN.

However, for security's sake, you will not be able (from any computer
besides your own, on which the appliance is running) to:

* access phpMyAdmin
* access Webmin
* link:#How_to_Transfer_Files_between_Appliance_and_Your_Computer[mount
John Harvard's home directory] in a window on your desktop

You will be able to:

* access John Harvard's homepage
* SSH to the appliance

Unfortunately, odds are `eth2` will not work on Harvard's campus because
of Harvard's firewall.

*Before activating `eth2`, you should first
link:#How_to_Change_Password[change John Harvard's password] to
something only you know for security's sake.*

To enable `eth2` temporarily, link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[open a
terminal] and execute:

`sudo ifup eth2`

If your LAN indeed supports DHCP, you should see:

`Determining IP information for eth2... done.`

To find out which IP address was assigned by your LAN to the appliance,
execute

`ifconfig eth2`

and look to the right of *inet addr* (not *inet6 addr*). That's the
address via which you can accessible the appliance from another computer
on your LAN. Odds are it will start with *192.168.0* or *192.168.1* or
*10.0.1*, though other prefixes are possible.

If you would like to enable `eth2` permanently:

1.  Select *Menu > Administration > Network*.
2.  Highlight *eth2* in the window that appears, then click *Edit*.
3.  Check *Activate device when computer starts*, then click *OK*.
4.  Select *File > Save*, then click *OK*.
5.  Select *File > Quit*.
6.  link:#How_to_Restart_Appliance[Restart the appliance].

Just realize that each time the appliance starts, it may be assigned a
different IP address on your LAN via DCHP, so you might need to re-run

`ifconfig eth2`

each time to find out the current address. If your home router supports
"DHCP reservations," know that you can find out the MAC (i.e., Ethernet)
address of `eth2` by running

`ifconfig eth2`

as well. Look to the right of *HWaddr* for the address. Alternatively,
if you think it's safe to assign the appliance a static IP address on
your LAN without your home router even knowing, select *Menu >
Administration > Network*, highlight *eth2* in the window that appears,
click *Edit*, select *Statically set IP addresses*, and configure the
interface as you see fit.

[[]]
How to Take a Screenshot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's sometimes helpful to take a screenshot of the appliance so that you
can remember or share something you see on your screen. *If officially
enrolled in a course at Harvard, just take care to respect the course's
policies on academic honesty.*

To take a screenshot inside of the appliance:

1.  Select *Menu > Accessories > Screenshot*.
2.  Check a *Region to capture*.
3.  Leave *Capture the mouse pointer* checked unless you'd like to hide
it.
4.  Leave *Delay before capturing* at *1*, unless you need more time.
5.  Click *OK*.
6.  You should then be prompted to decide on an *Action*. Leave *Save*
checked and then click *OK* if you'd like to save the screenshot as a
file; decide on a destination as prompted. You can then share that
screenshot with someone if necessary, as by opening Gmail in Firefox and
sending it as an attachment.

You can also link:#How_to_Share_Control_of_Your_Screen[share control of
your screen] if you need someone else to see more than a screenshot.

[[]]
How to Share Control of Your Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*This feature requires Internet access.*

So that you can help (and be helped by!) fellow learners on the
Internet, the appliance comes with
http://www.teamviewer.com/[TeamViewer], which lets you share (control
of) your screen with someone else (a "partner") on the Internet (and
vice versa). *If officially enrolled in a course at Harvard, just take
care to respect the course's policies on academic honesty.*

To share your screen with some else:

1.  Select *Menu > Share Screen*. A window should appear.
2.  Tell your partner the *ID* and *Password* that you see. Once your
partner inputs those values, your screen should be shared. Though if
your own computer has a firewall, you might first be prompted to "allow
incoming connections" or the like.

To see someone else's screen:

1.  Ask your partner for an *ID* and *Password*.
2.  Select *Menu > Share Screen*. A window should appear.
3.  Input the *ID* into that window, then click *Connect to partner*.
4.  When prompted, input the *Password*, at which point you should see
your partner's screen.

If you would like to connect to someone else's appliance from your own
computer (rather than from your own appliance) or from a mobile device,
you can download TeamViewer for free for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, or

Accessibility
-------------

The CS50 Appliance comes pre-configured with
http://live.gnome.org/Orca[Orca], a screen reader. To enable Orca,
select *Menu > Accessories > Orca*.

Note that Orca does work with:

* Chrome
* gedit (but not its built-in terminal window)
* NetBeans
* Xfce's menu (in the appliance's bottom-left corner)
* Xfce's panel (along the bottom of the appliance's screen)

But Orca does not work with:

* gedit's built-in terminal window
* Terminal
* Thunar, the appliance's file manager (via which you can open the
*Home* and *File System* icons on the appliance's desktop)

However, if you have a screen reader installed on your own computer, you
needn't rely on Orca alone. Instead, you can leverage your own screen
reader for navigation by link:#How_to_SSH_to_Appliance[SSHing to the
appliance] from your computer and by
link:#How_to_Transfer_Files_between_Appliance_and_Your_Computer[mounting
John Harvard's home directory] on your own computer.

*If you have suggestions on how to improve the appliance's
accessibility, please let sysadmins@cs50.net know!*

Implementation Details
----------------------

Below are details on how we implemented the CS50 Appliance in case
you're curious or would like to reproduce these steps yourself. *You do
NOT need to follow these directions to if you simply want to use the
CS50 Appliance:* you only need to follow link:#Instructions[the
instructions above].

We built the appliance using a combination of
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart[Kickstart] and
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package[rpmbuild]. It
took us a while to figure everything out, but now that we (and you) know
what we're doing, it only takes about 20 minutes to build the appliance
(and most of that time is spent waiting for Kickstart to run).

The CS50 Appliance's kickstart file can be found at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15.ks. And the CS50
Appliance's spec file can be found at
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15.spec.

The directions below assume familiarity with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)[Fedora] and
installation thereof as well as with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox[VirtualBox]. If you have
questions, you may want to join CS50's Google Group at
http://cs50.tv/2010/fall/#l=psets&r=group[cs50.tv].

1.  Download and install (on any OS) the latest version of VirtualBox
from http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
2.  Download an ISO of the 32-bit Fedora 16 DVD from
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/16/Fedora/i386/iso/Fedora-16-i386-DVD.iso
(which is linked at
http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora-options#formats).
3.  Launch VirtualBox and click *New*.
4.  On the screen entitled *Welcome to the New Virtual Machine Wizard!*,
click *Continue*.
5.  On the screen entitled *VM Name and OS Type*, input a value below
*Name* (e.g., *CS50 Appliance 3*), select *Linux* next to *Operating
System*, select *Fedora* (not *Fedora (64 bit)*) next to *Version*, then
click *Continue*.
6.  On the screen entitled *Memory*, input *768* MB, if not already
present, then click *Continue*. *If you input a value less than 768, the
Fedora 16 installer might hang.*
7.  On the screen entitled *Virtual Hard Disk*, check *Start-up Disk*
(if not checked already), select *Create new hard disk* (if not selected
already), then click *Continue*.
8.  On the screen entitled *Welcome to the Create New Virtual Disk
Wizard!*, select *VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)* (if not selected

18. Click *OK*.
19. In VirtualBox's lefthand list of VMs, single-click the VM to
highlight it, if not highlighted already, then click *Start*.
20. On the screen entitled *Welcome to the First Run Wizard!*, click
*Continue*.
21. On the screen entitled *Select Installation Media*, click the folder
icon under *Media Source*, navigate your way to the ISO you downloaded
earlier (i.e., *Fedora-16-i386-DVD.iso*), click it once to highlight it,
then click *OK*. You should then see *Fedora-16-i386-DVD.iso* under
*Media Source*. Click *Continue*.
22. On the screen entitled *Summary*, click *Done*.
23. Immediately click inside of the VM's window (so that your cursor
disappears). As soon as you see the screen entitled *Fedora 16*, hit
*Esc*. You should then see a *boot:* prompt.
24. At the *boot:* prompt, type
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
linux text biosdevname=0 ks=<nowiki>http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/appliance50-3-15.ks</nowiki> ksdevice=eth0 selinux=0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
then hit *Enter*. If you see *Error downloading kickstart file* after a
whole bunch of *assertion `NM_IS_DEVICE (device)' failed* messages,
simply select *OK* when prompted to try again. (Fedora 16's installer
seems to be buggy with respect to networking during kickstart.)
Kickstart will then proceed to install Fedora 16 and CS50's own RPMs.
Some number of minutes later (depending on the speed of your computer
and Internet connection), the VM will power itself off.
25. In VirtualBox's lefthand list of VMs, click the VM to highlight it,
if not highlighted already, then click *Settings*.

VMs, select *Machine > Clone...*.
2.  On the screen entitled *Welcome to the virtual machine clone
wizard*, input a name of *CS50 Appliance 3 for VirtualBox*, then click
*Continue*. (No need to check *Reinitialize the MAC address of all
network cards*.)
3.  On the screen entitled *Cloning Configuration*, select *Full Clone*,
then click *Clone*. In VirtualBox's lefthand list of VMs, the clone
should eventually appear.
4.  In VirtualBox's lefthand list of VMs, single-click the cloned VM to
highlight it, then click *Start*.
5.  As soon as the VM starts to boot, click inside of its window so that
your cursor is captured.
6.  Upon seeing a *GNU GRUB* screen, hit *Esc*.
7.  Highlight the first kernel in the menu (the one that doesn't mention
"recovery mode") with your arrow keys, if not highlighted already, then
hit *e*.
8.  Scroll down with your arrow keys to the line that begins with
*linux* and move your cursor to the right of
*/vmlinuz-#.#.#-#.fc16.i686* (where *#.#.#-#* is the kernel's version
number), immediately to the left of *root=*.
9.  Type *vmm=vbox*, leaving at least one whitespace to the left and to
the right, so that the whole line resembles:
+
--------------------------------------------------
linux /vmlinuz-#.#.#-#.fc16.i686 vmm=vbox root=...
--------------------------------------------------
10. Hit *ctrl-x*. The VM should resume booting, and installation of
Guest Additions should begin. (Hit *Esc* to watch the installation's
progress.)
11. Once the installation is complete and the VM has powered itself off,
select *Export Appliance...* from VirtualBox's *Devices* menu.
12. On the screen entitled *Welcome to the Appliance Export Wizard!*,
single-click the VM once to highlight it, if not highlighted already,
then click *Continue*.
13. On the screen entitled *Appliance Export Settings*, click
*Choose...* and navigate your way to a folder in which you'd like to
save the exported appliance. Select *Open Virtualization Format (*.ovf)*
next to *Files of type*, then input a filename (that ends in *.ovf*) for
the appliance next to *Save As* (e.g., *cs50-appliance-3.ovf*). Then
click *Save*.
14. Back on the screen entitled *Appliance Export Settings*, leave
*Write legacy OVF 0.9* and *Write Manifest file* unchecked, then click
*Continue*.
15. On the next screen also entitled *Appliance Export Settings*, click
*Done* without inputting any values. An inaccurate number of seconds
later, you should find two files in the folder you created:
*cs50-appliance-3.ovf* (which contain's the VM's configuration) and
*cs50-appliance-3.disk1.vmdk* (which is the VM's hard disk).
16. Replace *cs50-appliance-3.ovf* with
http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3-15.ovf.
17. Create a folder called *cs50-appliance-3* and then move
*cs50-appliance-3.ovf* and *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* into that
folder.
18. Create a ZIP of that folder called *cs50-appliance-3-15-ovf.zip*, as
with:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------
zip -r -n .vmdk  cs50-appliance-3-15-ovf.zip cs50-appliance-3/
--------------------------------------------------------------
+
This use of `-n` tells `zip` not to compress
`cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk` (since it's already compressed).
19. Distribute `cs50-appliance-3-15-ovf.zip`!
* *VMware*
1.  With *CS50 Appliance 3* highlighted in VirtualBox's lefthand list of

click *Save*.
4.  Back on the screen entitled *Appliance Export Settings*, leave
*Write legacy OVF 0.9* and *Write Manifest file* unchecked, then click
*Continue*.
5.  On the next screen also entitled *Appliance Export Settings*, click
*Done* without inputting any values. An inaccurate number of seconds
later, you should find two files in the folder you created:
*cs50-appliance-3.ovf* (which contain's the VM's configuration) and
*cs50-appliance-3.disk1.vmdk* (which is the VM's hard disk).
6.  Delete *cs50-appliance-3.ovf*.
7.  Download http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance/3/cs50-appliance-3.vmx.
8.  Create a folder called *cs50-appliance-3* and then move
*cs50-appliance-3.vmx* and *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* into that
folder.
9.  Execute:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/path/to/vmware-vdiskmanager -r cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk -t 0 new.vmdk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
`vmware-vdiskmanager` comes with VMware Fusion in
`/Application/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/` and with VMware
Workstation in `C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation` or
`C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\`.
10. Delete *cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* and rename *new.vmdk* to
*cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk*.
11. If you have VMware Fusion, launch it and select *File > Open...*. If
you have VMware Player or VMware Workstation, launch it and select *File
> Open*.
12. Navigate your way to *cs50-appliance-3.vmx* and open it.
13. As soon as the VM starts to boot, click inside of its window so that
your cursor is captured.
14. Upon seeing a *GNU GRUB* screen, hit *Esc*.
15. Highlight the first kernel in the menu (the one that doesn't mention
"recovery mode") with your arrow keys, if not highlighted already, then
hit *e*.
16. Scroll down with your arrow keys to the line that begins with
*linux* and move your cursor to the right of
*/vmlinuz-#.#.#-#.fc16.i686* (where *#.#.#-#* is the kernel's version
number), immediately to the left of *root=*.
17. Type *vmm=vmware*, leaving at least one whitespace to the left and
to the right, so that the whole line resembles:
+
----------------------------------------------------
linux /vmlinuz-#.#.#-#.fc16.i686 vmm=vmware root=...
----------------------------------------------------
18. Hit *ctrl-x*. The VM should resume booting, and installation of
VMware tools should begin. (Hit *Esc* to watch the installation's
progress.)
19. Once the installation is complete and the VM has powered itself off,
delete everything in *cs50-appliance-3/* except for
*cs50-appliance-3-disk1.vmdk* and *cs50-appliance-3.vmx*.
20. Create a ZIP of the *cs50-appliance-3* folder called
*cs50-appliance-3-15-vmx.zip*, as with:
+
----------------------------------------------------
zip -r cs50-appliance-3-15-vmx.zip cs50-appliance-3/
----------------------------------------------------
21. Distribute `cs50-appliance-3-15-vmx.zip`!

Troubleshooting
---------------

If having trouble with VirtualBox or the CS50 Appliance, see VirtualBox
and FAQs.

[[]]
Forget a password?
------------------

[[]]
I forgot John Harvard's password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

John Harvard's password is *crimson* by default. But if you changed it
to something you do not remember, you can change it to something you
know as follows:

1.  link:#How_to_Log_Out_of_Appliance[Log out] of the appliance if
already logged in.
2.  Log in as *root* with password *crimson* (unless you changed the
superuser's password too).
3.  link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[Open a terminal], execute
+
---------------
passwd jharvard
---------------
+
and input a new password for John Harvard (e.g., *crimson*) twice as
prompted.
4.  link:#How_to_Log_Out_of_Appliance[Log out] of the appliance.

You should then be able to log in as John Harvard again.

[[]]
I forgot the root password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The superuser's password is *crimson* by default. But if you changed it
to something you do not remember, you can change it to something you
know as follows:

1.  link:#How_to_Shut_Down_Appliance[Shut down the appliance] if it's
already running.
2.  link:#How_to_Start_Appliance[Start the appliance], immediately click
once inside of its window (so that your cursor disappears), and
immediately hold *Shift*. Within a few seconds, you should see a *GNU
GRUB* screen with *Generic* highlighted in white. If not, start over and
try again.
3.  Hit *e*, and you should see a screen with at least three options:
*root*, *kernel*, and *initrd*. Highlight *kernel* and hit *e* again.
You should then see a line of text that ends with `quiet`. Hit the space
bar and add the word `single` to the end of that line. Then hit *Enter*.
You should find yourself back at the previous screen, with *kernel*
highlighted in white.
4.  Hit *b* to boot into the appliance in "single-user mode.''' You
should soon see a terminal prompt.
5.  Execute
+
------
passwd
------
+
and input a new password twice (e.g., *crimson*) as prompted.
6.  Execute
+
------
reboot
------
+
to restart the appliance.

[[]]
I forgot John Harvard's (or root's) MySQL password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

John Harvard's password for MySQL is *crimson* by default, as is the
superuser's. But if you changed either to something you do not remember,
you can change both back to *crimson* by
link:#How_to_Open_a_Terminal[opening a terminal] and executing the
below:

`sudo yum -y reinstall cs50-appliance`

That command will restore the appliance to "factory defaults." It will
not delete any code that you've written.

Future Work
-----------

Below are features that may be included in some future version of the
appliance.

* Add back Usermin once it supports Fedora 16. (Currently usermin-1.490
doesn't detect generic-release as "Generic" because of its 3.x kernel.)
* Add Selenium.
* Add dnsmasq and resolve *.localdomain to 127.0.0.1.
* Add support for static IPs.
* Incorporate vhosts from cs164 RPM into cs50-appliance RPM.
* Relocate MySQL logs.
* Add vhost support for *.localdomain.
* Remove empty /etc/rc.d from cs50-appliance RPM?
* Remove /etc/sudoers from cs50-appliance RPM (as unnecessary because of
/etc/sudoers.d/cs50)?
* Add `PEERDNS=yes` to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 for
consistency with eth\{1,2}?
* Move proftpd dir out of /etc/webmin/ (seems to be there by accident?)?
