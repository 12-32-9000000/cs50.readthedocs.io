title: Expectations
---
Being part of the CS50 staff is (we think) one of the most awesomest
things you can do while at Harvard! It's fun, rewarding, and a fantastic
learning experience. That said, it is a big commitment of your time and
energy, so we want to be completely transparent about what's expected of
each staff member.

[[]]
All staff
~~~~~~~~~

* *Training.* You are expected to attend CS50 Staff Training,
tentatively scheduled for Sat 9/1/12 – Mon 9/3/12.
* *Staff meeting.* You are expected to attend our weekly staff meeting
held each Monday from 5:30pm – 7pm (tentatively). This is when we get
together to check in; prep for that week's section, office hours, and
assignment grading; and just hang out!
* *Lecture.* You are responsible for keeping up with lecture (by
attending and/or watching videos). It's critical that you're aware of
what's being covered and how so that you can give students support that
is coherent and aligns with the lectures. Nothing frustrates a student
more than a staff member who's not up-to-date with the latest material!
* *Email and help.cs50.net.* You are expected to participate in fielding
students' questions via email and http://help.cs50.net/[help.cs50.net].
* *CS50 Hackathon.* You are expected to participate throughout the night
of the Hackathon (currently slated for Wed 12/5/12, though this date may
change).
* *CS50 Fair.* You are expected to help set up on Sun 12/9/12, and to
participate in the CS50 Fair on Mon 12/10/12.
* *Asking for help when needed.* There will be times when you don't know
the answer to a student's question, get confused about a lecture, or
otherwise find yourself in a pickle. Instead of spinning your wheels or
pushing ahead blindly, stop and ask those of us who have more
experience; we're here to help! It's far less embarrassing to admit to
the staff that you don't get something than to have a student figure it
out (bad-staff-member gossip spreads fast).

Expectations by position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are additional expectations that differ slightly by staff
position, outlined below:

[[]]
CA
^^

_~4 hours per week_

* *Office Hours.* CAs hold 3 hours of office hours each week, and prompt
arrival and full participation are expected.

[[]]
TF
^^

_~12+ hours per week_

* *Office Hours.* You'll hold 3 hours of office hours each week, and
it's expected that you show up promptly and participate fully. However,
once your 3 hours are done, you're not expected to stay any longer.
* *Section.* Each week, TFs lead a 90-minute section for 15 – 18
students. The section is designed to briefly recap that week's lecture
material and do a hands-on exploration of the same. Typically TFs need
to spend some time beforehand to prepare and (re)familiarize themselves
with the material.
* *Assignment grading.* There are 9 problem sets and 1 final project in
total, and the expected turnaround time on grading each is less than one
week. This is in order to get students much-needed feedback before the
next assignment is due so that they can implement any changes necessary.
It is crucial to plan ahead for grading: it takes roughly 6-8 hours per
assignment, and getting behind is not an option.
* *Quiz grading.* We'll have two quiz-grading parties where we all get
together and grade students' work. TFs are expected to attend these
(dates pending). These are really super fun!
* *Materials.* Occasionally you'll be drafted to help prepare handouts,
solution sets, section notes, wiki articles, etc.

_Appointments are not guaranteed until enrollment is known at the end of
shopping period. SEAS ordinarily requires that TFs have an overall GPA
of 3.33 or higher._

Tutor
^^^^^

_~4 – 7 hours per week_

* *Tutoring.* You'll tutor 1 or more students per week according to
current need.
