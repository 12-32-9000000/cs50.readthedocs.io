Terminal is an SSH client that comes with Mac OS, so you don't need to
download or install it. Its icon can already be found in *Macintosh HD →
Applications → Utilities*. When you run Terminal (as by double-clicking
its icon), a (white) window like the below should appear.

Let's make a few changes to its configuration, though. Go to *Terminal →
Preferences...* You should see a window like the below.

Click *Pro* in the left-hand list of icons, then click *Default*. Your
window should then resemble the below, at which point you can close it.

Quit Terminal then re-run it. A (black) window like the below should
appear.

To actually SSH to a server (e.g., *cloud.cs50.net*) using Terminal,
execute

`ssh username@cloud.cs50.net`

at the prompt, where *username* is your own username. If you're asked
whether you're sure you want to continue connecting, type *yes*, then
*Enter*. You should then find yourself at the server's own prompt, as in
the below!
