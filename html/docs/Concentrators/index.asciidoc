Below is a visualization of the number of concentrators in Computer
Science since the concentration's introduction in 1984. In green are
graduates whose primary field (i.e., major) was Computer Science. In
yellow are graduates with joint concentrations whose "secondary
concentration" was Computer Science or whose secondary field (i.e.,
minor) was Computer Science; the Faculty of Arts and Sciences introduced
"secondary fields" in 2007.

*Data for the classes of 2013, 2014, and 2015 are incomplete (until
those classes' graduations).*
