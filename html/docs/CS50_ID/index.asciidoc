title: CS50_ID
---
CS50 ID is an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID[OpenID]-based service
that allows you to authenticate Harvard affiliates. It lives at
https://id.cs50.net/.

With CS50 ID, rather than ask users to log into your website (or even
register), you can instead redirect them to CS50 ID, where they'll be
prompted to log in with a Harvard email address or PIN. Once they've
authenticated, CS50 ID will redirect users back to your website, at
which point you'll know that they're indeed Harvard affiliates! CS50 ID
will provide you with a unique identifier for each user (that you can
use as a key in your own database). And, depending on how the user
logged in, CS50 ID might also provide you with the user's full name
and/or email address. CS50 ID will not provide you with users'
passwords, HUIDs, XIDs, or PINs.

To see CS50 ID in action, try out the
https://id.cs50.net/example/[example]. All the example does is tell you
whether you're logged in (and what information about you was returned by
CS50 ID).

[[]]
How CS50 ID Works
-----------------

Per CS50 ID's link:#Implementation_Details[implementation details], the
diagram below (inspired by
http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OpenID.html#Interaction[Google's
own]) depicts how CS50 ID works (in 8 steps, from top to bottom).

image:CS50_ID.png[CS50_ID.png,title="image"]

Thanks to the link:CS50 Library[CS50 Library], though, you don't need to
implement (or even understand!) all of these steps in order to
link:#How_to_Add_CS50_ID_to_Your_Website[add CS50 ID to your website].
Per the link:#Examples[examples] for link:#PHP[PHP],
link:#Python[Python], and link:#Ruby[Ruby], all you need do is call two
methods (inspired by https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk[Facebook's
own]):

* `getLoginUrl`, which returns a URL via which a user can log into CS50
ID
* `getUser`, which verifies CS50 ID's response

[[]]
How to Add CS50 ID to Your Website
----------------------------------

1.  Decide who should be allowed to log into your website. Even though
CS50 ID supports multiple options, it's best to choose just one so that
users always log in with the same account. If you allow users multiple
options (e.g., an `@college.harvard.edu` email address or an
`@fas.harvard.edu` address), a user might log in as
`jharvard@college.harvard.edu` one day but as `jharvard@fas.harvard.edu`
another day, in which case your website won't realize they're they same
user (since CS50 ID will return a different identifier for each). You
can allow:
* Anyone with a Harvard PIN
* Anyone with an `@college.harvard.edu` email address
* Anyone with an `@fas.harvard.edu` email address
* Anyone with an `@post.harvard.edu` email address
* Anyone with an `@seas.harvard.edu` email address
2.  Decide on:
* The URL at which your website will live (e.g.,
`<nowiki>https://cloud.cs50.net/~jharvard/</nowiki>`,
`<nowiki>http://isawyouharvard.com/</nowiki>`, etc.), otherwise known as
your `trust_root` (or `realm`) address. This must be a prefix of your
`return_to` address. *If you later need to change this address, you'll
need to contact sysadmins@cs50.net.*
* The URL to which CS50 ID should return users after authentication
(e.g.,
`<nowiki>https://cloud.cs50.net/~jharvard/return_to.php</nowiki>`,
`<nowiki>http://isawyouharvard.com/return_to.php</nowiki>`, etc.),
otherwise known as your `return_to` address. *If you later need to
change this address, you'll need to contact sysadmins@cs50.net.*
3.  Fill out the
https://spreadsheets1.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en&hl=en&formkey=dFkxWmJHSkd3N1haM1pRN3JabnFaRkE6MQ[CS50
ID Application]. If you don't hear back within 72 hours, email
sysadmins@cs50.net to inquire.
4.  Download the latest version of the link:CS50 Library[CS50 Library]
for http://mirror.cs50.net/library/php/[PHP],
http://mirror.cs50.net/library/python/[Python], or
http://mirror.cs50.net/library/ruby/[Ruby] and integrate it into your
website, per the link:#Examples[examples] below.

[[]]
config.php
^^^^^^^^^^

In this file, we define three constants:

* `TRUST_ROOT`, one of two URLs that you submitted on your
https://spreadsheets1.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en&hl=en&formkey=dFkxWmJHSkd3N1haM1pRN3JabnFaRkE6MQ[CS50

* `RETURN_TO`, one of two URLs that you submitted on your
https://spreadsheets1.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en&hl=en&formkey=dFkxWmJHSkd3N1haM1pRN3JabnFaRkE6MQ[CS50
ID Application].

And we also `require` the link:CS50 Library[CS50 Library].

code,php-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,php
<?php

    // URL that CS50 ID should ask users to trust; must be registered with CS50,
    // per the HOWTO at https://manual.cs50.net/ID; must be a prefix of RETURN_TO
    define("TRUST_ROOT", "https://cloud.cs50.net/~jharvard/");

    // URL to which CS50 ID should return users; must be registered with CS50,
    // per the HOWTO at https://manual.cs50.net/ID
    define("RETURN_TO", "https://cloud.cs50.net/~jharvard/return_to.php");

    // CS50 Library; ideally, this should not be inside public_html (or DocumentRoot)
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/relative/path/to/CS50/CS50.php");

    // ensure $_SESSION exists
    session_start();

?>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that, on `cloud.cs50.net` and in the link:CS50 Appliance[CS50
Appliance], the CS50 Library is installed in `/usr/share/php/`, which is
in PHP's `include_path`, which means you can `require` it with a much
shorter path:

code,php------------------------------ code,php
require_once("CS50/CS50.php");
------------------------------

[[]]
index.php
^^^^^^^^^

Notice how this file requires link:#config.php[config.php]. And notice
how it infers whether a user is logged in by checking whether
`$_SESSION["user"]` has a value; that value is set by
link:#return_to.php[return_to.php].

code,php------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,php
<?php

    // configuration
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/config.php");

?>

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en-us">

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta content="width=device-width" name="viewport">

            echo "You are not logged in.  <a href='login.php'>Log in</a>.";

      ?>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[]]
login.php
^^^^^^^^^

Rather than display a login form to the user, notice how this file
simply redirects the user to CS50 ID, specifically to the URL returned
by `getLoginUrl`, a static method defined in the link:CS50 Library[CS50
Library].

code,php------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,php
<?php

    // configuration
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/config.php");

    // if user is already logged in, redirect to index.php
    if (isset($_SESSION["user"]))
    {
        $protocol = (isset($_SERVER["HTTPS"])) ? "https" : "http";
        $host  = $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"];
        $path = rtrim(dirname($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]), "/\\");
        header("Location: {$protocol}://{$host}{$path}.php");
    }

    // else redirect user to CS50 ID
    else
        header("Location: " . CS50::getLoginUrl(TRUST_ROOT, RETURN_TO));

?>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[]]
return_to.php
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the page to which the user will be returned by CS50 ID (per the
definition of `RETURN_TO` in link:#config.php[config.php]). Note that
`getUser`, a static method defined in the link:CS50 Library[CS50
Library], will return an associative array that represents the user who
logged in via CS50 ID. Included in that associative array will be at
least one key:

* `identity`, a string (that happens to be a URL) that uniquely
identifies the user

Also included in that associative array may be one or both of these
keys:

* `email`, the user's Harvard email address, if the user logged in via
PIN or via an `@college.harvard.edu` or `@fas.harvard.edu` address
* `fullname`, the user's full name, if the user logged in via PIN

Note that `getUser` will return `false` if the user did not, in fact,
just log in successfully via CS50 ID.

Finally, note that we "remember" that the user has logged in by storing
the associative array returned by `getUser` as the value of
`$_SESSION["user"]`. Recall that link:#index.php[index.php] checks
`$_SESSION["user"]` to determine whether a user is logged in.

code,php---------------------------------------------------------------
code,php
<?php

    // configuration
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/config.php");

    // remember which user, if any, logged in
    $user = CS50::getUser(RETURN_TO);
    if ($user !== false)
        $_SESSION["user"] = $user;

    // redirect user to index.php
    $protocol = (isset($_SERVER["HTTPS"])) ? "https" : "http";
    $host  = $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"];
    $path = rtrim(dirname($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]), "/\\");
    header("Location: {$protocol}://{$host}{$path}.php");

?>
---------------------------------------------------------------

[[]]
logout.php
^^^^^^^^^^

Note that logouts are not handled by CS50 ID but by your own website. So
long as you have "remembered" that a user is logged in by storing the
associative array returned by `getLoginUrl` as the value of
`$_SESSION["user"]`, per link:#return_to.php[return_to.php], it suffices
to unset `$_SESSION["user"]` to log the user out; you should not
redirect the user back to CS50 ID.

code,php---------------------------------------------------------------
code,php
<?php

    // configuration
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/config.php");

    // if user is already logged in, log out
    if (isset($_SESSION["user"]))
        unset($_SESSION["user"]);

    // redirect user to index.php
    $protocol = (isset($_SERVER["HTTPS"])) ? "https" : "http";
    $host  = $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"];
    $path = rtrim(dirname($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]), "/\\");
    header("Location: {$protocol}://{$host}{$path}.php");

[[]]
Setup
^^^^^

Once you've installed Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and RubyGems, download a copy
of the CS50 Library from RubyGems via:

code,bash------------------ code,bash
$ gem install cs50
------------------

Now, create a new project, like `cs50id`:

code,bash------------------ code,bash
$ rails new cs50id
------------------

Now, add the CS50 library to the project by adding the following to
`/Gemfile`:

code,ruby---------- code,ruby
gem 'cs50'
----------

The project has been configured to use the CS50 Library, so a new
controller, called `Auth`, can be created to handle user authentication:

code,bash-------------------------------- code,bash
$ rails generate controller Auth
--------------------------------

[[]]
login
^^^^^

In order to log in, users will be redirected to CS50 ID, via a link
generated by the CS50 Library. We must specify the location of a
temporary directory to store login information, the registered
`TRUST_ROOT` and `RETURN_TO`, and the object representing the current
session. In `/add/controllers/auth_controller.rb`, create a new action
for logging in:

code,ruby-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,ruby
def login
    # user already logged in, redirect to index
    if (session["user"])
        redirect_to :action => :index

    # redirect to CS50 ID
    else
        redirect_to CS50.getLoginUrl(Rails.root.join("tmp"), "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3000/auth/return", session)
    end
end
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[]]
return
^^^^^^

Once the user authenticates via CS50 ID, they'll be brought back to
`<nowiki>http://localhost:3000/auth/return</nowiki>`. At this point, we
can retrieve information associated with the user that successfully
logged in. To do so, we must again specify our temporary directory and
RETURN_TO, as well as the current session and params objects (where the
user information is stored). Because our RETURN_TO is `/auth/return`, we
need to create a `return` action:

code,ruby-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,ruby
def return
    # get authenticated user information
    user = CS50.getUser(Rails.root.join("tmp"), "http://localhost:3000/auth/return", session, params)

    # remember which user, if any, logged in
    if (user)
        session["user"] = user
    end

    redirect_to :action => :index
end
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[]]
logout
^^^^^^

Because we stored user information in the session, a logout is
accomplished by clearing the session.

code,ruby--------------------------------------------------- code,ruby
def logout
    # clear the user's information from the session
    session["user"] = nil

    redirect_to :action => :index
end
---------------------------------------------------

[[]]
index
^^^^^

We have specified an `index` action in both `login` and `logout`, so we
must create one:

code,ruby--------- code,ruby
def index
end
---------

Now, create the corresponding view, `/app/views/auth.html.erb`:

code,ruby---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,ruby
<% if (session["user"]) %>

    You are logged in. <%= link_to "Log out", :action => "logout" %><br />
    Your unique ID for this site is <strong><%= session["user"]["identity"] %></strong><br />
    <% if (session["user"]["fullname"]) %>
        Your full name is <strong><%= session["user"]["fullname"] %></strong><br />
    <% end %>
    <% if (session["user"]["email"]) %>
        Your email address is <strong><%= session["user"]["email"] %></strong><br />
    <% end %>


<% else %>
    You are not logged in. <%= link_to "Log in", :action => "login" %>
<% end %>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, we must set up routes to the four actions we've created, so add
the following to `/app/config/routes.rb`

code,ruby------------------------------------ code,ruby
match 'auth' => 'auth#index'
match 'auth/login' => 'auth#login'
match 'auth/logout' => 'auth#logout'
match 'auth/return' => 'auth#return'
------------------------------------

To run the app, start the Rails server with:

code,bash--------- code,bash
$ rails s
---------

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth`. You should see a link to
log in, at which point you'll be redirected to CS50 ID. After
authenticating, you'll be brought back to your app, and you'll see your
user information and a logout link!

Implementation Details
----------------------

*If you would like to add CS50 ID to your own site, you probably only
need to follow the link:#How_to_Add_CS50_ID_to_Your_Website[directions
above].*

If, though, you would like to add CS50 ID to your website using some
library other than the link:CS50 Library[CS50 Library] or some language
other than link:#PHP[PHP], link:#Python[Python], and link:#Ruby[Ruby]
(which the link:CS50 Library[CS50 Library] supports), below are
implementation details for the technically curious.

[[]]
Overview
~~~~~~~~

CS50 ID is based on
http://openid.net/get-an-openid/what-is-openid/[OpenID], which "allows
you to use an existing account to sign in to multiple websites." In
http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#terminology[OpenID
terminology], CS50 is an _OpenID Provider_, and a website that uses CS50
ID (e.g., yours!) is a _Relying Party_. CS50's _OP Identifier_ (i.e.,
the address on which discovery should be performed) is
`<nowiki>https://id.cs50.net/</nowiki>`. (Note the `https`.)

As per link:#How_CS50_ID_Works[how CS50 ID works], whether you use the
link:CS50 Library[CS50 Library] or some other library to add CS50 ID to
your website, here's how authentication must flow:

1.  User tries to access a page on your website that requires login.
2.  Your website performs "discovery" for CS50 ID (via
http://yadis.org/papers/yadis-v1.0.pdf[Yadis] or
http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#html_disco[HTML]).
3.  CS50 ID responds to your website with its
https://id.cs50.net/xrds[XRDS file] (which contains CS50 ID's endpoint
URL).
4.  Your website establishes a shared secret with CS50 ID (using an
OpenID `associate` request), constructs a URL with which user can log in
via CS50 ID (using an OpenID `check_setup` request), and then redirects
user to that URL (as with an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection[HTTP
302] status code).
5.  CS50 ID prompts user to log in.
6.  User logs into CS50 ID.
7.  CS50 ID redirects user back to your website (via a URL whose
parameters include digitally signed OpenID fields, among which are a
unique identifier for the user as well as, possibly, the user's full
name and/or email address).
8.  Your website verifies CS50 ID's digital signature, remembers (as
with a server-side session) that the user is now logged in, and then
shows the user the page that required login.

OpenID Authentication 2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CS50 ID supports
http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html[OpenID
Authentication 2.0] but with these constraints:

* A Relying Party must be approved to use CS50 ID. Review
link:#How_to_Add_CS50_ID_to_Your_Website[How to Add CS50 ID to Your
Website] to apply for approval.
* Discovery must be performed via
http://yadis.org/papers/yadis-v1.0.pdf[Yadis] or
http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#html_disco[HTML].
http://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/2.0/specs/cd02/xri-resolution-V2.0-cd-02.html[XRI
Resolution] is not supported.
* Only `checkid_setup` is supported for authentication;
`checkid_immediate` is not supported. CS50 ID requires interactive
authentication.
* Claimed Identifiers are not supported for `checkid_setup`. A Relying
Party MUST provide a value of
`<nowiki>http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/identifier_select</nowiki>`
for both `openid.claimed_id` and `openid.identity`.
* CS50 ID responds to `check_setup` requests with a unique identifier of
the form +
`<nowiki>https://id.cs50.net/################################################################</nowiki>` +
 for both `openid.claimed_id` and `openid.identity`, where +
`################################################################` +
represents 64 hexadecimal digits. That identifier is dependent on the
account with which the user authenticated: if John Harvard authenticates
as `jharvard@college.harvard.edu`, CS50 ID will return a different
identifier than it would if John Harvard authenticates as
`jharvard@fas.harvard.edu`. CS50 ID does not allow users to "link"
accounts (whereby the same identifier would be returned for a user, no
matter the account with which the user authenticated).

FAQs
----

[[]]
How should I store users in my database?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a user authenticates, CS50 ID returns an 84-character URL that
uniquely identifies that user; the URL begins with
`<nowiki>https://id.cs50.net/</nowiki>` (which is 20 characters in
length) and ends with 64 hexadecimal digits. In a MySQL database, you
can thus store that identifier in a `CHAR( 84 )` field. For efficiency,
though, it's best to associate a unique, auto-incrementing `INT` with
each user as well (so that you can `SELECT` users based on 4 bytes
instead of 84), as with the schema below (which assumes that `email` and
`fullname` will be no more than 128 characters each):

code,sql---------------------------------------------------- code,sql
CREATE TABLE  `users` (
`id` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
`identity` CHAR( 84 ) NOT NULL ,
`fullname` VARCHAR( 128 ) NULL DEFAULT NULL ,
`email` VARCHAR( 128 ) NULL DEFAULT NULL ,
UNIQUE (
`identity`
)
) ENGINE = MYISAM ;
----------------------------------------------------

In theory, you could probably get away with storing only the URL's
trailing 64 hexadecimal digits, but, to be consistent with OpenID, you
should store all 84, especially if you might decide to allow your users
to log in via other means as well (e.g., via
http://www.janrain.com/products/engage[Janrain Engage]).

[[]]
Why does CS50 ID uniquely identify users with 84-character URLs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CS50 ID is based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID[OpenID], which
dictates that users be uniquely identified with URLs. By convention,
OpenID providers (like CS50) return URLs based on domains that they own
(e.g., `id.cs50.net`) so that their identifiers won't be identical to
other providers' by accident. CS50 thus standardized on URLs that begin
with `<nowiki>https://id.cs50.net/</nowiki>`.

[[]]
Why doesn't CS50 ID always return a user's full name and/or email
address?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a user authenticates, CS50 ID will always return an 84-character
URL that uniquely identifies that user. Depending on how a user
authenticates, CS50 ID might also return the user's full name and/or
email address.

CS50 ID may return a user's full name if a user authenticates via:

* a Harvard PIN
* an `@college.harvard.edu` email address
* an `@fas.harvard.edu` email address
* an `@seas.harvard.edu` email address

CS50 ID will not return a user's full name if a user authenticates via:

* an `@post.harvard.edu` email address

CS50 ID will return a user's email address if a user authenticates via:

* an `@college.harvard.edu` email address
* an `@fas.harvard.edu` email address
* an `@seas.harvard.edu` email address

CS50 ID may return a user's email address if a user authenticates via:

* a Harvard PIN

CS50 ID will not return a user's email address if a user authenticates
via:

* an `@post.harvard.edu` email address

[[]]
Can I develop my site on localhost (127.0.0.1)?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, even though you must register your own website's URLs, CS50 ID also
trusts URLs that begin with `<nowiki>http://localhost/</nowiki>` and
`<nowiki>http://127.0.0.1/</nowiki>` automatically so that you can
develop your website locally and still interact with CS50 ID, provided
you're running a web server that's listening for requests on `localhost`
or `127.0.0.1` (on any TCP port). During development, simply change
`TRUST_ROOT` and `RETURN_TO`, per the link:#Examples[examples], to refer
to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`; just be sure that `RETURN_TO` is still a
prefix of `TRUST_ROOT`. Note that, when using `localhost` or
`127.0.0.1`, you'll be able to log into CS50 ID using any supported
account (email, PIN, etc.), not just those that you chose to enable when
you registered for CS50 ID.

*You do not need to register `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` when you apply
for CS50 ID.*

When ready to launch your website, just remember to change `TRUST_ROOT`
and `RETURN_TO` to the URLs with which you applied for CS50 ID.

Can I develop my site on a private network?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, even though you must register your own website's URLs, CS50 ID also
trusts URLs that refer to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces[private
IPv4 addresses] (e.g., 192.168.56.50) automatically so that you can
develop your website locally and still interact with CS50 ID, provided
you're running a web server that's listening for requests on an private
IPv4 address (on any TCP port). During development, simply change
`TRUST_ROOT` and `RETURN_TO`, per the link:#Examples[examples], to refer
to the server's private IP address; just be sure that `RETURN_TO` is
still a prefix of `TRUST_ROOT`. Note that, when using a private IPv4
address, you'll be able to log into CS50 ID using any supported account
(email, PIN, etc.), not just those that you chose to enable when you
registered for CS50 ID.

*You do not need to register your server's private IPv4 address when you
apply for CS50 ID.*

When ready to launch your website, just remember to change `TRUST_ROOT`
and `RETURN_TO` to the URLs with which you applied for CS50 ID.

Troubleshooting
---------------

[[]]
The site you tried to log into is not configured properly for CS50 ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a user reports seeing this message, odds are you're using incorrect
(or unapproved) values for `TRUST_ROOT` and/or `RETURN_TO` in your code.
Best to double-check those values.

If still unsure what's wrong (or if you don't recall which URLs we
approved), email sysadmins@cs50.net to inquire.

[[]]
Invalid username and/or password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a user reports seeing this message, odds are the user is using the
wrong account, username, and/or password. Encourage the user to try
again.

If the user continues to have trouble logging in ...

* ... with an `@college.harvard.edu` account, ask the user to try
logging into https://webmail.college.harvard.edu/. If the user *cannot*,
refer the user to https://webmail.college.harvard.edu/feedback.asp. If
the user *can*, email sysadmins@cs50.net to inquire, CCing the user.
* ... with an `@fas.harvard.edu` account, ask the user to try logging
into https://webmail.fas.harvard.edu/. If the user *cannot*, refer the
user to help@fas.harvard.edu or 617-495-5000. If the user *can*, email
sysadmins@cs50.net to inquire, CCing the user.
* ... with an `@seas.harvard.edu` account, ask the user to try logging
into both https://mail.seas.harvard.edu/ and
https://email.seas.harvard.edu/. If the user *cannot* log into either,
refer the user to help@fas.harvard.edu or 617-495-5000. If the user
*can* log into at least one, email sysadmins@cs50.net to inquire, CCing
the user.
* ... with a PIN, ask the user to try logging into
https://id.cs50.net/example/ via PIN. If the user *cannot*, refer the
user to http://reference.pin.harvard.edu/login-help. If the user *can*,
email sysadmins@cs50.net to inquire, CCing the user.
