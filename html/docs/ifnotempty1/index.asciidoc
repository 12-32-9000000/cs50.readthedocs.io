#if:|p1|p2}}||}}

This is a version of Template:Ifnotempty with the condition-string equal
to the then-part. In this case using this separate template is
especially useful if the expansion of the condition-string/then-part
gives a large preprocessor node count, as it avoids doubling this
amount.

Spaces and newlines are ignored for the condition, but preserved in the
result.
