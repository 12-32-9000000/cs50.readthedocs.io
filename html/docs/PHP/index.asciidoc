*PHP* is a programming language used mainly for _server-side scripting_.
When you access a page generated by a PHP script, like this one, the
server that processes your request will execute the PHP code that exists
on the server (for example, the `index.php` file that lives somewhere on
the CS50 servers), and the output of the script will be sent back to
your browser. Compare JavaScript, which is usually sent to your browser
by the server, and then executed on your computer by the browser.
