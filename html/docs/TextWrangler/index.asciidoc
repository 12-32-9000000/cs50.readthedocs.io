TextWrangler is a text editor for Mac OS that you can download from
http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html[http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html].
Once downloaded, mount the `.dmg` file (if not already mounted
automatically) by double-clicking its icon, then double-click the icon
that appears on your desktop. In the window that appears, drag
*TextWrangler* to your *Applications* folder. Then open up your
*Appications* folder and double-click TextWrangler's own icon within to
launch the text editor.

Because TextWrangler comes with built-in support for SFTP, you can use
it to edit files that actually live in the link:CS50 Appliance[CS50
Appliance] (or any other server that supports SFTP).

Note that to actually compile or execute programs, you'll still want to
SSH to the appliance with Terminal or use Terminal inside the
appliance..
