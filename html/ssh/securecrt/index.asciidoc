SecureCRT is a commercial SSH client for Windows for which Harvard has a
site license. It's installed on most PCs in labs on campus, but, on your
own PC, best to install link:../putty[PuTTY] instead (since you can
continue using it after you leave Harvard). To run SecureCRT, simply
double-click its icon. You should see a window like the below.

Let's add *cloud.cs50.net* to the list. Click the third icon (from the
right) on top for a *New Session*. Click *Next*, and type
*cloud.cs50.net* for the Hostname. Go *Next*, then *Finish*. You should
now see cloud.cs50.net under Sessions, like below:

Let's make a few changes to its configuration, though. (Because PCs in
labs on campus tend to reset themselves after you log out, you may need
to make these changes every time you use SecureCRT.) Right-click
*cloud.cs50.net*, then choose *Properties*. In the window that appears,
click *Emulation* under *Terminal*, then select *Linux* from the
drop-down menu to the left of *ANSI color*. (The box immediately to the
left of *ANSI Color* should become checked automatically.) Then input
*32000* next to *Scrollback buffer*. Your window should ultimately
resemble the below.

Next click *Emacs* under *Emulation* and check *Use ALT as meta key*,
per the below.

Then click *OK*. You should be returned to the window below.

To actually SSH to a server, double-click, e.g., *cloud.cs50.net*. If
you see a window like the below, click *Accept & Save*.

Type your own username when prompted, as in the below, then click *OK*.

Then type your password, as in the below, then click *OK*.

You should then find yourself at the server's prompt, as in the below!
