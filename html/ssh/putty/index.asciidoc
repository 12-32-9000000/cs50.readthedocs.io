PuTTY is a free SSH client for Windows that you can download from
http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe[http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe].
Once downloaded, there's no need to install PuTTY, per se, since what
you just downloaded is the program itself! You're welcome to move it to
*C:\Program Files\* or wherever you'd like. To run PuTTY, simply
double-click its icon. You should see a window like the below.

Let's make a few changes to its configuration, though. Under *Host Name
(or IP address)* enter the address of a server to which you plan to SSH
(e.g., *cloud.cs50.net*), then type that same address under *Saved
Sessions*, then click *Save*. Your window should then resemble the
below.

To actually SSH to a server, double-click, e.g., *cloud.cs50.net* under
*Saved Sessions*. If you see a window like the below, click *Yes*.

When prompted to login as, enter your username, then *Enter*, then your
password (whose characters you won't actually see for security reasons),
then *Enter*. You should then find yourself at the server's prompt, as
in the below!
