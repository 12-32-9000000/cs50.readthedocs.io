Each fall, CS50 offers a series of link:Seminars[seminars]. Led by the
course's own https://www.cs50.net/staff[staff] as well as by
http://huit.harvard.edu/[HUIT staff] and
http://www.abcd.harvard.edu/[ABCD members], CS50 seminars are designed
to equip students with skills and savvy beyond the scope of the course's
own https://www.cs50.net/syllabus/[syllabus]. Below are instructions on
how to lead a seminar.

* Before your seminar, please email any slides/source code to Chris at
thayer.07@gmail.com so folks can download during the seminar.
* Before your seminar, please figure out how to increase your terminal
window's and text editor's font size to 18pt+ so that it's readable in
the room and on camera.
** In gedit, it's *Edit > Preferences > Font & Colors*.
** In Terminal, it's *Edit > Preferences... > Appearances*.
* Be sure to bring a laptop with VGA output to your seminar.
* During your seminar, do zoom in as needed so that folks in back can
see okay. (On a Mac, you can enable zoom under *Apple Menu > System
Preferences > Universal Access*.)
* If you use a white background for your slides, best to avoid light
colors, such as pastels. For slides with a black background, avoid dark
colors, including red, as they're difficult to see in video.
* Also avoid light colors if the background to your text editor is
white; avoid dark colors if the background is black.
* Please arrive 15 minutes ahead of time of your scheduled seminar.
* Make sure not to show any personal information you don't mind sharing
with the world (e.g., phone numbers, IDs, pictures, addresses, etc.) on
screen.
* If you're using a Mac and don't have a VGA dongle, let us know. We may
have one you can borrow during your presentation.
* Please repeat any questions from the audience, as your mic will not
pick up their voices. I'll remind you if you forget during the seminar.
* Some stage directions: Make sure to look at the audience and/or the
camera as much as possible (connect with the viewers!).
* If you don't have access to the building we're filming in, please let
us know!
