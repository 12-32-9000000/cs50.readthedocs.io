Every 10 minutes, we take "snapshots" of everything in `/home` on
`cloud.cs50.net`, just in case you accidentally delete something.

How to Recover a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose that you just deleted `~/pset1/hello.c`. Odds are you'll find it
in the `minutely.0` or `minutely.1` snapshot, depending on the current
time, in which case you can recover it with

`cp /snapshots/minutely.0/home/username/pset1/hello.c ~/pset1`

or with

`cp /snapshots/minutely.1/home/username/pset1/hello.c ~/pset1`

where `username` is your own username. If you need to recover an earlier
version, you can go further back in time via `minutely.2`, `minutely.3`,
or `minutely.4`. If you'd instead like to go back an hour or so, you can
start with `hourly.0`, followed by `hourly.1`, `hourly.2`, and so on.
Below are all of the intervals you can try. Realize that the times only
estimates, since the intervals' definitions depend on the current time.
