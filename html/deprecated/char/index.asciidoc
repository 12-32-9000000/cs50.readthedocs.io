*char* is the data type for characters, or symbols found in the
link:ASCII#Table[ASCII table]. It is often pronounced "ch-ar," but "car"
is also common. A `char` variable can hold a single character. A `char`
constant (e.g. the link:int[`int`]'s equivalent of numbers) is denoted
by single quotation marks, e.g. `'a'` represents the letter a and `'*'`
represents the asterisk. For example,

[source,c]
---------------
 char c = 'r'; 
---------------

stores the letter r into `c`. An array of `char`s make up a string.

Although an link:printf#Escape_Characters[escape character] visually
appears as two characters (e.g. the `\` and another letter), it is
treated as a single `char` because the `\` is special in C and doesn't
count as a character. Hence, the C compiler treats escape characters
like `\n` as a single `char` and referring to them requires the use of
single quotes (e.g. `'\n'`).
