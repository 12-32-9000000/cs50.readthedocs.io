*Note: Prior to 11:45am on 10/10/10, the Quiz was subject to the below
listed errata.*

I have always taught a section "for those less comfortable". Over the
last several years I have made my sections "practice quizzes" that are
full of questions similar to those you might find on the quiz. There are
always way more questions than actually would ever appear on the quiz,
but I have always received positive feedback on them from my students.
The materials that comprise these practice quizzes come primarily from
either (a) me or (b) the former "section notes". This is the
Media:Quiz0-Lloyd2.pdf[practice quiz] I am distributing to my section in
2010. You should feel free to use this quiz for your own section if you
like. I'd appreciate an e-mail letting me know before you do, if you
choose to.

The answer key is Media:Quiz0Answers-lloyd2.pdf[here]. Note that this
answer key corresponds to the current version of the practice quiz, not
the earlier posted version that contained some errors. These were
prepared using LaTeX.

Errata in version distributed prior to 11:45am on October 10, 2010
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Question 7, the function declaration should read:
`int *mult_binomials(int A[2], int B[2])`

In Question 24, the function's body should read: `
   if(y == 0)
      return 1;
   else
      return x * secret(x, y-1);
`

Question 31 should precede Question 32. Students should be using the
solution to `gcd()` to solve `lcm()`.
