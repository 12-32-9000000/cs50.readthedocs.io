title: Bit
---

A bit, short for binary digit, represents a number of either 0 or a 1.
In other words, it represents the values that can occupy a single
position in a link:Binary[binary] number. It is therefore the most
fundamental unit of computing memory and storage, and it is frequently
used in combination with link:#_prefixes[prefixes] to refer to quantities
of permanent storage, memory, connection bandwidth, and others.

Most commonly, bits are referred to in groups of 8, known as a byte.
Since there are 8 positions of 2 possible values, a single byte is made
up of 2^8^ discrete values and can therefore store 256 different numbers
from 0 to 255.


Prefixes
~~~~~~~~

Due to the sheer quantity of bits that a modern computer can store and
transmit in a given time, we typically refer to large numbers of both
bits and bytes with prefixes. Below is a table of common prefixes used
in reference to bits and bytes.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=============================================================
|Prefix |Abbreviation |Power of 2 Value |SI Value
|kilo- |K |2^10^ = 1024 |10^3^ = 1000
|mega- |M |2^20^ = 1048576 |10^6^ = 1000000
|giga- |G |2^30^ = 1073741824 |10^9^ = 1000000000
|tera- |T |2^40^ = 1099511627776 |10^12^ = 1000000000000
|peta- |P |2^50^ = 1125899906842624 |10^15^ = 1000000000000000
|=============================================================

The abbreviations are used in combination with abbreviations for bit
(lowercase b) and byte (uppercase B) to represent different possible
combinations. There are other prefixes (such as Exa-, Zetta-, and
Yotta-) that continue along the same pattern as above, but what is shown
are the most typical prefixes.

A few examples of usage from the above table:

* 1 kilobit (1 Kb) = 1,024 bits.
* 1 kilobyte (1 KB) = 1,024 bytes = 8,192 bits.
* 1 megabyte (1 MB) = 1,048,576 bytes = 8,388,608 bits.
* 8 bigabytes (8 GB) = 8,589,934,592 bytes = 64 gigabits (64 Gb) =
68,719,476,736 bits.

Notice that the above table reference two different types of values:
powers of 2 and SI (given as powers of 10). Typically is the "Power of 2
Value" column used in the context of computers. Occasionally, this can
lead to confusion in the meaning of the prefix. For example, hard drive
manufacturers advertise the capacity of their products with SI prefixes,
so that, say, a 100 GB hard drive represents 100*10^9^ bytes. When the
computer reads the number of bytes on the drive, though, it computes the
prefix using powers of 2 and might therefore say that the drive has 93
GB (100*10^9^ divided by 1073741824), rather than the advertised 100 GB.

Technically, the prefixes above are SI prefixes, and therefore the SI
values are the correct values. However, the computing industry has taken
them over over the years to also mean the corresponding power of 2
definition in various contexts due to the history of their use.
Typically, being able to differentiate between the SI value and the
power of 2 value requires additional context.

In an effort to combat this confusion, newer prefixes have been defined.
Though not found very frequently, there has been a recent push to use
the below standards instead of the commonly used prefixes above. This
revised prefix table shows that SI prefixes retain their correct values,
and the powers of two are moved to new prefixes defined by a standard
from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

|=======================================================================
|IEC Prefix |IEC Value |SI Prefix |SI Value
|kibi- (Ki) |2^10^ = 1024 |kilo- (K) |10^3^ = 1000

|mebi- (Mi) |2^20^ = 1048576 |mega- (M) |10^6^ = 1000000

|gibi- (Gi) |2^30^ = 1073741824 |giga- (G) |10^9^ = 1000000000

|tebi- (Ti) |2^40^ = 1099511627776 |tera- (T) |10^12^ = 1000000000000

|pebi- (Pi) |2^50^ = 1125899906842624 |peta- (P) |10^15^ =
1000000000000000
|=======================================================================

Some examples from this revised model:

* 1KiB (1 kibibyte) = 1024 bytes = 8192 bits.
* 1KB (1 kilobyte) = 1000 bytes = 8000 bits.

Note that, while you might see the IEC prefixes in use (especially in
documents from the European Union, many contexts within Linux, and Mac
OS X Snow Leopard 10.6), the table shown at the top of this section is
still the most commonly used reference to computer memory in the United
States.
