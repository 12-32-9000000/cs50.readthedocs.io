I have always taught a section "for those less comfortable". Here is my
"cheat sheet" for Media:CheatSheet6.pdf[Week 6] (sorry for the small
font!). 2010 was the first year I made these, and I intend to hand them
out (1) after section (2) only to those people who actually attended.
These are intended as a two-page capsule summary of important topics.
The goal is to refresh students' minds on these for quiz-preparation
purposes, ie. to remember the syntax of a loop. If other TFs intend to
use them, please keep the attribution to me, and just send me an email
saying that you are using them. These were prepared using LaTeX.

And here's some Media:Week6Lloyd.pdf[sample code] that illustrates the
concepts covered in that (and Week 4's) cheat sheet.
